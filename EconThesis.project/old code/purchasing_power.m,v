@function deltaPP = purchasing_power(simulation, weights, inflation) 
    %Preconditions
    %simulation is a numMonths x numFacts matrix
    %weights is a row vector of size numFacts
    %inflation is a vector of each year's inflation. It is technically not
    %necessary because we assume it to be 2.5% every year but this is more
    %extensible
    
    %Postconditions
    %Returns the change in purchasing power from first year to last year
    
    %VARIABLES
    y = spending(simulation, weights, .055, 3, .05);
    
    %Need to discount the value at year t by (1+inflation_rate)^t. 
    %First year has discount rate of (1+inflation_rate)^0 = 1
    maxYear = size(y,1);
    difference = (y(maxYear,:) / ((1+inflation)^maxYear)) - y(1,:);
    
    %What we want at the end is the difference in portfolio values
    %However, we are allowed to sum up the asset values for last year and
    %first year and take the quotient of them. Why?
    %Because the second approach looks like asset1/(1+inflation)^maxYear +
    %asset2/(1+inflation)^maxYear + ... + assetn/(1+inflation)^maxYear -
    %asset1/1 - asset2/1 - asset3/1 - ... - assetn/1. But that's exactly
    %the the difference in portfolio returns, which is
    %(asset1+asset2+...assetn)/(1+inflation)^maxYear -
    %asset1-asset2...-assetn. Thus the two approaches are equivalent
    deltaPP = sum(difference) / sum(y(1,:));
    
    %If we have starting_money, then starting_money*deltaPP is how
    %much we have gained or lost.
