            meeting]
               We have reproduced and implemented the concepts of the JPMorgan paper
            as a starting point for our investigation of the value of rebalancing as a consider-
            ation for allocating assets in the mean-CVaR framework. The historical return
            data of our asset classes benchmarks are first tested for first order monthly
            autocorrelation and then &#8217;unsmoothed&#8217; to remove autocorrelation.  Next, the
            historical return data are individually fit to marginal Generalized Pareto Dis-
            tributions before combining the historical correlation matrix and fit to a joint
            t-Copula distribution. We then run simulations for monthly returns for 3 years
            by drawing out of the joint t-Copula distribution.  We optimize our efficient
            frontier for return and CVaR based on this simulation dataset only.
               We begin the one-period (buy and hold) CVaR analysis by establishing a
            baseline for comparison.  The weights of the mean-variance efficient frontiers
            for historical arithmetic averages and unsmoothed historical arithmetic aver-
            ages are applied to our simulation data to determine the CVaR and return of
            each weight. The pseudo-mean-CVaR efficient frontier derived from these mean-
                                            5

            variance weights are used as the starting weights for finding the optimal portfo-
            lio, assuming there is another weight that can provide a lower CVaR and/or a
            higher return.  We use MATLAB&#8217;s built-in optimization function &#8217;fmincon&#8217; for
            finding an optimal efficient frontier. The objective function to be minimized is
            the CVaR while the non-linear constraint to be satisfied is a set return, the av-
            erage return of the portfolio across the simulations must be approximately equal
            to the constraint. We generate an efficient frontier by using each of the histori-
            cal mean-variance portfolio returns as our non-linear constraints for finding the
            minimum CVaR.
               Next, we investigate the ability for multi-period optimization and account for
            rebalancing in constructing the efficient frontier.  We first implement a simple
            model that rebalances back to the target weight every 12 months and incurs
            no transaction costs.  We integrate the rebalancing function to our objective
            function in calculating portfolio CVaRs and into our non-linear constraint for
            calculating average portfolio returns across all simulations for our &#8217;fmincon&#8217;
            optimization.   We are currently investigating the use of a decision function
            for determining whether to rebalance at each specified time period based on
            transaction cost, deviation from the target weights, change in portfolio variance,
            or change in portfolio CVaR.
               We will compare our CVaR based efficient frontiers to their respective mean-
            variance counterparts to determine the strengths and weaknesses of both meth-
            ods.  We will use historical data as well as newly generated simulation data
            for testing hypotheses. We may also investigate the use of investor expectation
            in generating the simulation returns by using the expected mean and expected
            standard deviation of each asset class.

            Rebalancing
               The literature reviewed up to this point only considers a single time frame
            portfolio optimization, where an asset allocation is set at the beginning of the
            period and the portfolio is untouched until the end of the investment period.
            Seth J. Master&#8217;s a simple rebalancing strategy involves setting a target allocation
            and an investor only rebalances when the allocation deviates beyond a set of
            trigger points. For instance, if the trigger point is 3% for all asset classes, then an
            investor only rebalances when the weight for any asset class deviation more than
            3% from the target weight. This is also known as a tolerance band rebalancing
            strategy. According to Seth Master, any rebalancing strategy should incorporate
            some basic assumptions. The benefit of rebalancing is inversely proportional to
            an investor&#8217;s risk preference: if an investor is risk tolerant, meaning he is willing
            to endure higher risk for higher potential returns, then his benchmarks will be
            smaller, meaning he will rebalance less often.  Assuming transaction costs are
            fixed and not proportional to the transaction size, the cost of rebalancing is
            linear:  selling twice as much of an asset would cost twice as much.  The net
            benefit of rebalancing is the difference between the benefit of rebalancing and
            the cost of rebalancing.
               Walter Sun extended the idea of Seth Master&#8217;s paper to incorporate dynamic
            programming to minimize cost of rebalancing. Walter applies the idea to CAPM
            models, which assume that asset returns are stationary, and that mean and
            variance are the primary portfolio statistics of interest.  The optimal strategy
            is that one rebalances only when the expected cost of trading is less than the
            expected cost of doing nothing.  His conclusion is that periodic or tolerance
            band rebalancing provide suboptimal rebalance portfolios. However, by treating
            rebalancing problem as an optimization problem and solving it using dynamic
            programming, he was able to reduce overall costs of portfolio rebalancing.
                                            7

               Taking rebalancing one step further, Gianfranco Guastaroba applied rebal-
            ancing strategies to portfolio optimization model that uses Conditional Value
            at Risk (CVaR) as a measure of risk, the same framework we are using.  The
            model incorporated rebalancing as a set of linear programming constraints. He
            introduced a decision variable that indicated whether to rebalance based on
            whether portfolio allocation deviated from a certain quantile. He also specified
            a fixed cost and a variable cost for buying/selling assets.  The constraint was
            that, during every rebalancing period, an investor rebalanced if net portfolio
            return taking into account fixed and proportional transaction costs is at least
            the predetermined required return.  The paper then used four in-sample-out-
            of-sample windows to test the model for different levels of minimum required
            returns (0, 5%, and 10%) and different quantile measures (1%, 5%, 10% and
            25%).  He concluded that for a very risk-averse investor the best choice is to
            rebalance two or three times in six months. On the other hand, a less risk-averse
            investor should rebalance one time or not rebalance at all.
               These papers give us a starting point for incorporating rebalancing into our
            model. Our goal is to analyze and compare the different rebalancing strategies
            available:  a simple periodic strategy in which we rebalance every few months,
            a tolerance-band strategy in which we rebalance when allocation deviates be-
            yond a predetermined range, or a dynamic programming approach that actively
            calculates the expected cost of future transactions.  We will then incorporate
            the use of t-copulas for fat tails, CVaR as a risk measure, and rebalancing as a
            portfolio strategy to produce a realistic asset allocation framework for a large
            institutional investor such as an endowment.
            Implementation
               In our implementation, we adopt a 12-month periodic rebalancing strategy.
                                            8

            We have 5000 simulations of returns for seven asset classes, a set of starting
            weights derived from the mean and variance framework, and a set of fixed port-
            folio returns.  Every 12 months, we sum up the returns in that year and we
            distribute the portfolio value according to a predetermined set of weights, and
            then compound it with future returns.
               Our rebalancing framework could thus be expressed as a linear programming
            minimization problem:
                                  min
                                w1,w2,...wn CVaR(w1,w2,...,wn)                  (1)
                                     w1,w2,...,wn &#x003E; 0                       (2)
                                   w1 + w2 + ... + wn = 1                     (3)
                              &#x02DC;R(w1,w2,...,wn) = R(w1,w2,...,wn)               (4)
            where R is the fixed portfolio monthly return rate and  &#x02DC; R is the calculated
            portfolio monthly return at each run of the simulation.
               Our goal is to find the set of weights that will minimize CVaR given a fixed
            level of return.  Our two linear constraints indicate that the weights must be
            nonnegative since no borrowing is allowed and that the weights sum up to one.
            We also have a nonlinear constraint. Since we want to fix return, our nonlinear
            constraint is that our final portfolio return  &#x02DC; R is the same as the given fixed
            portfolio return R.
               Our objective function is to find the weights that will minimize CVaR. CVaR
            is calculated analatically by trying out a set of asset weights all 5000 simulations.
            Each simulation gives a final portfolio value, from which we could derive the
            monthly retun rate. For instance, suppose we start with 1 (billion) endowment,
            and the final portfolio value is 24.62 (billion). Suppose we simulate 36 months
                                            9

            into the future, rebalancing every 12 months, Then our monthly return rate is
            24.621&#x2215;35-1
________
      12    = 0.00799 monthly return rate. For each set of trying weights, we go
            throught all 5000 simulations, giving us 5000 monthly return rates. To calculate
            the CVaR, we take the average of the lowest 5%, or 250 final returns.  That is
            our CVaR. We will keep trying weigts in an analytical fashion until we find
            the minimun CVaR. The MATLAB funtion fmincon allows us to do this.  The
            objective function and the constraints are precisely the same as in the linear
            programming problem.

<!--l. 116--><p class="indent" >   We have reproduced and implemented the concepts of the JPMorgan paper as a
starting point for our investigation of the value of rebalancing as a consideration
for allocating assets in the mean-CVaR framework. The historical return
data of our asset classes benchmarks are first tested for first order monthly
autocorrelation and then &#8217;unsmoothed&#8217; to remove autocorrelation. Next, the
historical return data are individually fit to marginal Generalized Pareto
Distributions before combining the historical correlation matrix and fit to a
joint t-Copula distribution. We then run simulations for monthly returns

for 3 years by drawing out of the joint t-Copula distribution. We optimize
our efficient frontier for return and CVaR based on this simulation dataset
only.
<!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >   We begin the one-period (buy and hold) CVaR analysis by establishing a baseline
for comparison. The weights of the mean-variance efficient frontiers for historical
arithmetic averages and unsmoothed historical arithmetic averages are applied to our
simulation data to determine the CVaR and return of each weight. The
pseudo-mean-CVaR efficient frontier derived from these mean-variance weights are
used as the starting weights for finding the optimal portfolio, assuming there is
another weight that can provide a lower CVaR and/or a higher return. We use
MATLAB&#8217;s built-in optimization function &#8217;fmincon&#8217; for finding an optimal
efficient frontier. The objective function to be minimized is the CVaR while the
non-linear constraint to be satisfied is a set return, the average return of
the portfolio across the simulations must be approximately equal to the
constraint. We generate an efficient frontier by using each of the historical
mean-variance portfolio returns as our non-linear constraints for finding the minimum
CVaR.
<!--l. 144--><p class="indent" >   Next, we investigate the ability for multi-period optimization and account for
rebalancing in constructing the efficient frontier. We first implement a simple model
that rebalances back to the target weight every 12 months and incurs no transaction
costs. We integrate the rebalancing function to our objective function in calculating
portfolio CVaRs and into our non-linear constraint for calculating average
portfolio returns across all simulations for our &#8217;fmincon&#8217; optimization. We are
currently investigating the use of a decision function for determining whether to
rebalance at each specified time period based on transaction cost, deviation
from the target weights, change in portfolio variance, or change in portfolio
CVaR.

<!--l. 156--><p class="indent" >   We will compare our CVaR based efficient frontiers to their respective
mean-variance counterparts to determine the strengths and weaknesses of both
methods. We will use historical data as well as newly generated simulation data for
testing hypotheses. We may also investigate the use of investor expectation in
generating the simulation returns by using the expected mean and expected standard
deviation of each asset class.

<!--l. 171--><p class="indent" >   The literature reviewed up to this point only considers a single time frame
portfolio optimization, where an asset allocation is set at the beginning of the period
and the portfolio is untouched until the end of the investment period. Seth J.
Master&#8217;s a simple rebalancing strategy involves setting a target allocation and an
investor only rebalances when the allocation deviates beyond a set of trigger points.
For instance, if the trigger point is 3% for all asset classes, then an investor only
rebalances when the weight for any asset class deviation more than 3% from the
target weight. This is also known as a tolerance band rebalancing strategy. According
to Seth Master, any rebalancing strategy should incorporate some basic assumptions.
The benefit of rebalancing is inversely proportional to an investor&#8217;s risk
preference: if an investor is risk tolerant, meaning he is willing to endure
higher risk for higher potential returns, then his benchmarks will be smaller,
meaning he will rebalance less often. Assuming transaction costs are fixed and
not proportional to the transaction size, the cost of rebalancing is linear:
selling twice as much of an asset would cost twice as much. The net benefit of
rebalancing is the difference between the benefit of rebalancing and the cost of

rebalancing.
<!--l. 191--><p class="indent" >   Walter Sun extended the idea of Seth Master&#8217;s paper to incorporate dynamic
programming to minimize cost of rebalancing. Walter applies the idea to
CAPM models, which assume that asset returns are stationary, and that mean

strategy is that one rebalances only when the expected cost of trading is less
than the expected cost of doing nothing. His conclusion is that periodic or
tolerance band rebalancing provide suboptimal rebalance portfolios. However, by
treating rebalancing problem as an optimization problem and solving it
using dynamic programming, he was able to reduce overall costs of portfolio
rebalancing.
<!--l. 203--><p class="indent" >   Taking rebalancing one step further, Gianfranco Guastaroba applied rebalancing
strategies to portfolio optimization model that uses Conditional Value at Risk
(CVaR) as a measure of risk, the same framework we are using. The model
incorporated rebalancing as a set of linear programming constraints. He
introduced a decision variable that indicated whether to rebalance based on
whether portfolio allocation deviated from a certain quantile. He also specified
a fixed cost and a variable cost for buying/selling assets. The constraint
was that, during every rebalancing period, an investor rebalanced if net
portfolio return taking into account fixed and proportional transaction costs
is at least the predetermined required return. The paper then used four
in-sample-out-of-sample windows to test the model for different levels of minimum
required returns (0, 5%, and 10%) and different quantile measures (1%, 5%,
10% and 25%). He concluded that for a very risk-averse investor the best
choice is to rebalance two or three times in six months. On the other hand,
a less risk-averse investor should rebalance one time or not rebalance at
all.

where <span

monthly return at each run of the simulation.
<!--l. 261--><p class="indent" >   Our goal is to find the set of weights that will minimize CVaR given a fixed level
of return. Our two linear constraints indicate that the weights must be nonnegative
since no borrowing is allowed and that the weights sum up to one. We also have a
nonlinear constraint. Since we want to fix return, our nonlinear constraint is that
our final portfolio return <img 
src="econ_thesis_-_draft_01_Perry5x.png" alt="&#x02DC;R"  class="tilde" > is the same as the given fixed portfolio return
<span 
class="cmmi-10">R</span>.
<!--l. 269--><p class="indent" >   Our objective function is to find the weights that will minimize CVaR. CVaR is
calculated analatically by trying out a set of asset weights all 5000 simulations. Each
simulation gives a final portfolio value, from which we could derive the monthly retun

rate. For instance, suppose we start with 1 (billion) endowment, and the final
portfolio value is 24.62 (billion). Suppose we simulate 36 months into the future,
rebalancing every 12 months, Then our monthly return rate is <img 
src="econ_thesis_-_draft_01_Perry6x.png" alt="24.621&#x2215;35-1-
   12"  class="frac" align="middle"> = 0.00799
monthly return rate. For each set of trying weights, we go throught all 5000
simulations, giving us 5000 monthly return rates. To calculate the CVaR, we take the
average of the lowest 5%, or 250 final returns. That is our CVaR. We will
keep trying weigts in an analytical fashion until we find the minimun CVaR.
The MATLAB funtion <span 
class="ecss-1000">fmincon </span>allows us to do this. The objective function
and the constraints are precisely the same as in the linear programming
problem.
