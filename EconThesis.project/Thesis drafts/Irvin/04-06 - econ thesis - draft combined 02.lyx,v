Markowitz (1952) pioneered the use of mean-variance optimization to understand
 the tradeoff between risk and return for a portfolio of risky assets.
 Markowitz assumed asset returns are normally distributed, allowing for
 an analytical solution to the minimization of variance and the maximization
 of expected return.
 The elegant analytical solution of this optimization problem is a set of
 portfolios along the efficient frontier that represents the best possible
 obtainable returns and variances.
 Markowitz had set the foundation for asset allocation research and understandin
g the tradeoff between risk and return in a portfolio of risky assets.

Beyond Normal and Variance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
The assumptions of normality and variance as a risk measure in asset allocation
 have come under pressure since the groundbreaking work of Markowitz's portfolio
 theory
\change_inserted 0 1269661079
 in light of the market crises in the past two decades
\change_unchanged
.
 Research in the past decade has focused on accommodating the occurrence
 of extreme events and more relevant measures of risk besides variance.
 The applications of this research utilizes simulation data to understand
 the tradeoff between risk and return with computer optimization techniques.
 Our research aims to further develop the mean-CVaR framework along with
 the t-Copula probability distribution to incorporate portfolio rebalancing
 and to compare these strategies against traditional mean-variance frameworks.

Sheikh and Qiao (2009)
\change_unchanged
 provide a real world application and verification of the use of fat tail
 distributions and CVaR as a risk measure in an asset allocation framework.
 They 
\change_deleted 0 1269700803
conclude
\change_inserted 0 1269700808
 demonstrate
\change_unchanged
 that a fat tail distribution better describes the real world market environment
 than a normal distribution
\change_inserted 0 1269700843
 by showing that the Student’s t-copula more closely fits the historical
 data, especially the extreme events, than does the normal copula.
 
\change_unchanged
.
 The paper also briefly touches on CVaR as a risk measure that better accounts
 for downside risk than variance.
 
\change_deleted 0 1269700838
It shows that the Student’s t-copula more closely fits the historical data,
 especially the extreme events, than does the normal copula.
 
\change_unchanged
The paper then briefly looks at asset allocation using CVaR as a risk measure.
 It shows that the use of a Student’s t-copula assumption provides a lower
 downside risk (through lower CVaR) than does the use of a normal copula.
 
\change_deleted 0 1269700916
JPMorgan’s paper demonstrates an implementation of the t-copula and CVaR
 in an asset allocation framework fits historical data better than does
 the traditional mean-variance framework.
 
\change_unchanged
Our research will focus on the 
\change_deleted 0 1269700923
implementation
\change_inserted 0 1269700924
verification
\change_unchanged
 and continuation of this asset allocation model with 
\change_deleted 0 1269700936
constraints, cash reserves, and 
\change_unchanged
rebalancing.
 We will also look at the historical accuracy and advantage of using our
 asset allocation model in comparison to the traditional mean-variance asset
 allocation framework.

t-Copula
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
In traditional mean-variance portfolio optimization frameworks, Monte Carlo
 simulations are run from a Gaussian (normal) joint distribution for 
\change_deleted 0 1269791190
the
\change_inserted 0 1269791191
a
\change_unchanged
 basket of asset classes.
 The shortfall of this method is the thinness of the tail, implying a very
 low likelihood for situations where all asset classes are falling significantly
 in market crash scenarios.
 The advantage of using a t-copula is 
\change_inserted 0 1269791199
that 
\change_unchanged
it can accommodate higher probabilities of joint events (crashes or bubbles).
 A copula combines marginal cumulative distribution functions (CDF) and
 historical data of each asset class to create a best fit 
\change_inserted 0 1269791220
joint 
\change_unchanged
multivariate 
\change_deleted 0 1269791219
joint
\change_unchanged
 distribution.
 A Gaussian copula assumes a multivariate normal distribution whereas a
 t-copula utilizes a multivariate Student’s t-distribution, allowing for
 fatter tails.
 The t-copula provides a more accurate representation of real world financial
 markets and the probability of extreme events (Demarta and McNeil, 2004).

Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as Risk Measure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Variance provides a mathematically simple measure of risk for asset allocation,
 but it adds little value as a measure of downside risk.
 Variance symmetrically accounts for both upside risk and downside risk
 since it is simply a measure of the sample’s average squared deviation
 from the arithmetic mean.
 When investment managers 
\change_deleted 0 1269791234
look at
\change_inserted 0 1269791237
assess
\change_unchanged
 risk, they are typically concerned with downside risk or losses and 
\change_deleted 0 1269791244
view
\change_inserted 0 1269791245
consider
\change_unchanged
 upside risk (which may be referred to as “excess return”) as a result of
 skill, expertise, 
\change_inserted 0 1269791251
and 
\change_unchanged
good fortune
\change_deleted 0 1269791249
, and value added
\change_unchanged
.
 Value-at-risk (VaR) has been incorporated as another risk measure that
 aims to better account for downside risk than variance.
 VaR is the minimum 
\change_inserted 0 1269791270
expected 
\change_unchanged
loss
\change_deleted 0 1269791269
 expected
\change_unchanged
 at a certain confidence level (typically 5%) and can be calculated by taking
 the value of the return at the specified (5%) boundary of a probability
 density function (PDF) of return data (either historical or simulated).
 Although VaR 
\change_deleted 0 1269791284
does a better job of accounting
\change_inserted 0 1269791286
better accounts
\change_unchanged
 for downside risk than variance
\change_inserted 0 1269791292
 does
\change_unchanged
, it 
\change_deleted 0 1269791306
does not
\change_inserted 0 1269791306
fails to
\change_unchanged
 capture the extent of the possible losses beyond the specified (5%) cutoff.
 It is possible to have two PDF’s with the same VaR (loss associated with
 the cutoff of 5%) but one with a fatter tail and greater losses to the
 left of the specified (5%) cutoff.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) attempts to rectify this problem: it is
 the expected loss given a loss beyond the value-at-risk and can be calculated
 as a weighted average of the worst case losses.
 Furthermore, CVaR is a more reliable risk measure than VaR under non-normal
 and non-continuous probability distributions because it is a “coherent
 risk measure” and is “sub-additive and convex” (p.
 3, Krohmal, Palmquist, and Uryasev, 2002).
 
\change_deleted 0 1269791333
In other words,
\change_inserted 0 1269791335
This means that
\change_unchanged
 the CVaR of a portfolio is always less than or equal to the sum of the
 CVaR of the weights of the individual asset classes and can be extended
 from continuous probability distributions to discrete scenarios
\change_deleted 0 1269791320
 such as in simulations
\change_unchanged
, allowing for optimization using simulations or discrete distributions
 and eliminating anomalous results such as multiple local minima.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Rockafellar and Uryasev (1999) demonstrate the use of CVaR in an asset allocatio
n framework and the ability to optimize CVaR using linear programming methods.
 The ability to use linear programming stems from the way CVaR is calculated.
 Theoretically, CVaR is simply the average value beyond the specified cutoff
 (5%) calculated using the calculus of integrals.
 Rockafellar and Uryasev demonstrate
\change_deleted 0 1269791351
d
\change_unchanged
 that the use of simulations and a summation to estimate the theoretical
 CVaR can be exploited to find the minimum CVaR.
 The minimization of CVaR in most situations also provides a minimum VaR
 because CVaR is always greater than VaR.
 Only in situations of extreme skewness does the minimum VaR differ greatly
 from the minimum CVaR.
 Rockafellar and Uryasev demonstrate the theoretical and mathematical possibilit
y of optimizing CVaR for portfolio asset allocation.

 optimization using CVaR as a risk measure and t-Copula as a joint probability

Rebalancing

\begin_layout Standard

\change_deleted 0 1269792117
The previous literature review considers a single time frame portfolio optimizat
ion, where an asset allocation is set at the beginning of the period and
 the portfolio is unchanged until the end of the investment period.
  
\change_unchanged
Master (2003) offers a simple rebalancing strategy, which involves setting
 a target allocation.
  The investor only rebalances when the allocation deviates beyond a set
 of trigger points.
  For instance, if the trigger point is 3% for all asset classes, then an
 investor only rebalances when the weight for any asset class deviates more
 than 3% from the target weight.
  This is also known as a tolerance band rebalancing strategy.
  According to Master, any rebalancing strategy should incorporate some
 basic assumptions.
  The benefit of rebalancing is inversely proportional to an investor's
 risk preference: if an investor is risk tolerant, meaning he is willing
 to endure higher risk for higher potential returns, then his tolerance
 band will be wider, meaning he will rebalance less often.
  It 
\change_deleted 0 1269792197
is also worthwhile to
\change_inserted 0 1269792199
should also be
\change_unchanged
 note
\change_inserted 0 1269792200
d
\change_unchanged
 that the benefit of rebalancing rises geometrically.
  For example, rebalancing at deviation of 6% 
\change_inserted 0 1269792208
from the
\change_deleted 0 1269792207
of
\change_unchanged
 target allocation provides up to four times as much benefit as rebalancing
 at deviation of 3% of target allocation.
  
\change_inserted 0 1269792235
The key benefit of rebalancing is to reduce this tracking error.
 
\change_unchanged
Mathematically this can be represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Rebalancing Benefit }=\frac{{\text{Tracking Error}^{2}\cdot\delta^{2}}}{2\cdot\text{Risk Tolerance}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the deviation from the target allocation and Tracking Error represents
 how closely a portfolio follows the target allocation to which it is benchmarke
d.
  
\change_deleted 0 1269792228

\change_deleted 0 1269792299

asset classes
\change_inserted 0 1269792277
capital across asset classes and 
\change_deleted 0 1269792285
, which 
\change_inserted 0 1269792285
 
\change_unchanged
incurs costs.
  While the benefit of rebalancing rises geometrically, transaction costs
 of rebalancing are linear: selling twice as much of an asset would cost
 twice as much.
  The net benefit of rebalancing is the difference between the benefit of
 rebalancing and the cost of rebalancing.
  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Sun (2006) extends the idea of Master’s paper to incorporate dynamic programming
 to minimize the cost of rebalancing.
  Sun applies the idea to CAPM models, which assume that asset returns are
 stationary, and that mean and variance are the primary portfolio statistics
 of interest.
  The optimal strategy is to rebalance only when the expected cost of trading
 is less than the expected cost of doing nothing.
  His conclusion is that periodic or tolerance band rebalancing provides
 suboptimal rebalanced portfolios.
  However, by treating the rebalancing problem as an optimization problem
 and solving it using dynamic programming, Sun was able to reduce overall
 costs of portfolio rebalancing.
  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Guastaroba (2009) applies rebalancing strategies to a portfolio optimization
 model that uses Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as the risk measure.
 The model incorporates rebalancing as a set of linear programming constraints.
  He introduces a decision variable to determine whether to rebalance based
 on 
\change_deleted 0 1269792365
whether
\change_inserted 0 1269792368
 how much
\change_unchanged
 the portfolio allocation deviate
\change_inserted 0 1269792371
s
\change_deleted 0 1269792371
d
\change_unchanged
 from a predetermined quantile.
  
\change_deleted 0 1269792389
He also incorporates both f
\change_inserted 0 1269792389
F
\change_unchanged
ixed and variable transaction costs
\change_inserted 0 1269792405
 are both incorporated in the rebalancing decision
\change_unchanged
.
  During every rebalancing period, an investor rebalances if net portfolio
 return, taking into account fixed and proportional transaction costs, is
 at least the predetermined required return.
  The paper then uses four in-and-out-of-sample windows to test the model
 for different levels of minimum required returns (0, 5%, and 10%) and different
 quantile measures (1%, 5%, 10% and 25%).
  Based on the back-testing results, he concludes that for a very risk-averse
 investor the best choice is to rebalance two or three times in six months.
  On the other hand, a less risk-averse investor should rebalance one time
 or not rebalance at all.

These papers give us a starting point for incorporating rebalancing into
 our model.

\change_deleted 0 1269747182
  Our goal is to analyze and compare the different rebalancing strategies:
 a simple periodic strategy that rebalances every few months, a tolerance-band
 strategy that rebalances when allocation deviates beyond a predetermined
 range, or a dynamic programming approach that actively calculates the expected
 cost of future transactions.

Arithmetic and Compounding Returns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 0 1269792666
We use two methods for calculating returns for a given time period.
 In the arithmetic approach, returns from a period are added to returns
 in the next period.
 In the compounding approach, returns from a period are compounded with
 the returns in the next period.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 be the return during period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{t}$
\end_inset

 be the portfolio value at the end of period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, we can express the two approaches as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\change_inserted 0 1269792549
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\text{Compounding: }V_{t+1}=V_{t}\cdot(1+r_{t+1})\end{equation}

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\text{Arithmetic: }V_{t+1}=V_{t}+r_{r+1}.\end{equation}

\end_inset

The use of arithmetic returns is mathematically and computationally convenient.
 Our initial analyses utilize arithmetic returns before extending the mean-CVaR
 framework to consider compounding and rebalancing.

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
The historical data of each individual asset class are first fit to independent,
 marginal Generalized Pareto Distribution; this GPD fit is piecewise so
 that a different function is fit to the lower tail and upper tail to account
 for marginal distribution fat tails.
 Next, independent marginal CDFs are transformed into their inverses, creating
 a uniform distribution over [0, 1].
 The historical returns are then applied to their respective inverse CDF's
 to determine a marginal probability of occurrence.
 Using Maximum Likelihood, a multivariate t-distribution fit is then constructed
 over these inverse CDF historical probabilities to construct a t-copula
 that is identified by a new correlation matrix and a single degree of freedom.

The resulting t-Copula fit is centered at zero with characteristic fat tails,
 similar to a standard normal distribution, and is used for generating simulatio
ns.

In order to simulate a certain number of months into the future, we generate
 multiple single month returns for all asset classes.
 A single month's return is simulated for all asset classes by generating
 multivariate random numbers from the t-Copula fit and applying it to the
 following formula:

Analytical Mean-Variance Optimization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Markowitz (1952) pioneered the use of the normal mean-variance optimization
 framework for maximizing portfolio returns and minimizing portfolio risk
 (standard deviation).
 This framework analytically calculates the optimal set of portfolio returns
 and variances using the historical average return and historical standard
 deviation of each asset class along with the historical covariance between
 each pair of asset classes.
 The optimization problem can be expressed as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\min_{w_{1},w_{2},...w_{n}}\text{{\sigma^{2}}}(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})\end{equation}

 The optimization uses multiple levels of

 between the lowest and highest single asset class return (where the portfolio
 is 100% weighted in that single asset class) to determine the set of portfolios

The single period optimization of mean-CVaR minimizes CVaR at each given
 level of return.
 The optimization calculates the CVaR as described previously while satisfying
 the condition that the average return across all simulations is equal the

 Since this is a single period optimization, arithmetic returns are used.

Our objective function is to find the weights that will minimize CVaR.
 CVaR is calculated analytically by trying out a set of asset weights for
 all 5000 simulations.
 Each simulation gives a final portfolio value, from which we can derive
 the monthly return rate by the formula:

r=\frac{{V_{f}^{1/p}-1}}{b}\end{equation}

 is the monthly return rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{f}$
\end_inset

 is the final portfolio value, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the number of periods we simulate into the future, and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is number of months in between which we rebalance.
 A periond is the interval in which we rebalance once; it is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 months.
 For instance, suppose we start with

 Suppose we simulate 36 months into the future, rebalancing every 12 months.
 Then our monthly return rate is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{24.62^{1/3}-1}{12}=0.16$
\end_inset

 monthly return rate by the formula.
 For each set of weights, we carry out 5000 simulations, giving us 5000
 monthly return rates.
 We take the average of the lowest 5%, or 250 final returns, to give us
 one CVaR.
 Our objective is to find the minimum CVaR.
 We will keep trying weights in an analytical fashion until we find the
 minimum CVaR.

The degrees of freedom signifies the degree of the fat tails.
 A degree of freedom of infinite is essentially a normal distribution; previous
 literature have found t-copulas with a degree of freedom of 32 to be a
 very close approximation of a normal copula.

We created analytical mean-variance efficient frontiers using the average
 returns and observed variances of the historical data, the unsmoothed historica
l data, and the simulation data.
 The similarity of the three efficient frontiers is a result of the similarity
 of the mean and variance statistics.

The results indicate that there exists a set of portfolios that has a lower
 CVaR (or higher return) than any of the analytical mean-variance portfolios.
 The portfolios that had maximized return and minimized variance in the
 previous optimization had a greater CVaR than portfolios that had minimized
 CVaR.
 This suggests the mean-variance optimization does not protect against situation
s of extreme losses and should not be the only consideration in asset allocation
 especially of preventing extreme downside risk is a concern.

Future research into the tradeoff between CVaR and variance may prove rewarding
 since both risk measures could prove relevant in different contexts.
 Also, a three dimensional optimization that maximizes return while minimizing
 variance and minimizing CVaR will produce an efficient frontier that is
 a plane.
 This would be an interesting framework for understanding the tradeoffs
 between return, variance, and downside risk and merits future investigation.

The mean-variance efficient frontier weights are not the most optimal allocation
s in both the rebalancing mean-CVaR framework and the compounding mean-CVaR
 framework.
 Significant improvement in return or in lower CVaR can be obtained in the
 compounding and rebalancing framework with different allocations than the
 normal mean-variance framework suggests.

The achievement of higher returns and lower CVaR for the compounding portfolios
 in comparison to the rebalancing portfolios, especially at higher risk
 and return levels, must be considered in light of the use of a t-copula.
 The compounding and rebalancing portfolios at lower risk and lower CVaR
 are very similar but quickly diverge as the risk and CVaR increases.
 We believe this is because the t-copula is symmetric, so there exists a
 fat upper tail as well as a fat lower tail.
 In this case, compounding may outperform rebalancing by becoming overweight
 in high risk-high return assets.

The use of a t-copula to generate simulations appears to play a significant
 role in comparing the efficient frontiers of compounding and rebalancing
 in a mean-CVaR framekwork.
 [Should I run comparisons with a normal copula to see what happens? in
 comparison? or mention it as future research?]

Future research implementing transaction costs and a decision variable to
 determine when to rebalance may prove valuable in this mean-CVaR framework.

Although the standard t-copula to fit to the historical data did account

 Future research may consider asymmetric copulas such as the Gumbel or Clayton
 copulas.
