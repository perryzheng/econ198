Markowitz (1952) pioneered the use of mean-variance optimization to understand
 the tradeoff between risk and return for a portfolio of risky assets.
 Markowitz assumed asset returns are normally distributed, allowing for
 an analytical solution to the minimization of variance and the maximization
 of expected return.
 The elegant analytical solution of this optimization problem is a set of
 portfolios along the efficient frontier that represents the best possible
 obtainable returns and variances.
 Markowitz had set the foundation for asset allocation research and understandin
g the tradeoff between risk and return in a portfolio of risky assets.

Beyond Normal and Variance

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
The assumptions of normality and variance as a risk measure in asset allocation
 have come under pressure since the groundbreaking work of Markowitz's portfolio
 theory in light of the market crises in the past two decades.
 Research in the past decade has focused on accommodating the occurrence
 of extreme events and more relevant measures of risk besides variance.
 The applications of this research utilizes simulation data to understand
 the tradeoff between risk and return with computer optimization techniques.
 Our research aims to further develop the mean-CVaR framework along with
 the t-Copula probability distribution to incorporate portfolio rebalancing
 and to compare these strategies against traditional mean-variance frameworks.

In traditional mean-variance portfolio optimization frameworks, Monte Carlo
 simulations are run from a Gaussian (normal) joint distribution for a basket
 of asset classes.
 The shortfall of this method is the thinness of the tail, implying a very
 low likelihood for situations where all asset classes are falling significantly
 in market crash scenarios.
 The advantage of using a t-copula is that it can accommodate higher probabiliti
es of joint events (crashes or bubbles).
 A copula combines marginal cumulative distribution functions (CDF) and
 historical data of each asset class to create a best fit joint multivariate
 distribution.
 A Gaussian copula assumes a multivariate normal distribution whereas a
 t-copula utilizes a multivariate Student’s t-distribution, allowing for
 fatter tails.
 The t-copula provides a more accurate representation of real world financial
 markets and the probability of extreme events (Demarta and McNeil, 2004).

Another problem with the mean-variance optimization framework is that it
 assumes underlying returns are uncorrelated across time (Fisher, 1994).
 This is clearly not the case, as higher returns in one period ususally
 lead to equally higher returns the next period because the expectation
 is high.
 To correct for this auto-correlation between period-to-period returns and
 to establish the independence of single-period returns, we used the well-known
 Fisher-Geltner-Webb's

 methodology.

Variance provides a mathematically simple measure of risk for asset allocation,
 but it adds little value as a measure of downside risk.
 Variance symmetrically accounts for both upside risk and downside risk
 since it is simply a measure of the sample’s average squared deviation
 from the arithmetic mean.
 When investment managers assess risk, they are typically concerned with
 downside risk or losses and consider upside risk (which may be referred
 to as “excess return”) as a result of skill, expertise, and good fortune.
 Value-at-risk (VaR) has been incorporated as another risk measure that
 aims to better account for downside risk than variance.
 VaR is the minimum expected loss at a certain confidence level (typically
 5%) and can be calculated by taking the value of the return at the specified
 (5%) boundary of a probability density function (PDF) of return data (either
 historical or simulated).
 Although VaR better accounts for downside risk than variance does, it fails
 to capture the extent of the possible losses beyond the specified (5%)
 cutoff.
 It is possible to have two PDF’s with the same VaR (loss associated with
 the cutoff of 5%) but one with a fatter tail and greater losses to the
 left of the specified (5%) cutoff.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\change_inserted 0 1270513931
Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) attempts to rectify this problem: it is
 the expected loss given a loss beyond the value-at-risk and can be calculated
 as a weighted average of the worst case losses (Agrawal, 2008).
 Formally, let X be a random variable denoting a portfolio's loo and 
\begin_inset Formula $VaR_{\alpha}(X)$
\end_inset

 be the VaR at the 
\begin_inset Formula $100(1-\alpha)\%$
\end_inset

 confidence level.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $CVaR_{a}(X)$
\end_inset

 is defined as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 0 1270513618
\begin_inset Formula \[
CVaR_{\alpha}(X)=E[X|X\text{≥}Var_{\alpha}(X)]\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 0 1270513609
Furthermore, CVaR is a more reliable risk measure than VaR under non-normal
 and non-continuous probability distributions because it is a “coherent
 risk measure” and is “sub-additive and convex” (p.
 3, Krohmal, Palmquist, and Uryasev, 2002).
 This means that the CVaR of a portfolio is always less than or equal to
 the sum of the CVaR of the weights of the individual asset classes and
 can be extended from continuous probability distributions to discrete scenarios
, allowing for optimization using simulations or discrete distributions
 and eliminating anomalous results such as multiple local minima.

Rockafellar and Uryasev (1999) demonstrate the use of CVaR in an asset allocatio
n framework and the ability to optimize CVaR using linear programming methods.
 The ability to use linear programming stems from the way CVaR is calculated.
 Theoretically, CVaR is simply the average value beyond the specified cutoff
 (5%) calculated using the calculus of integrals.
 Rockafellar and Uryasev demonstrate that the use of simulations and a summation
 to estimate the theoretical CVaR can be exploited to find the minimum CVaR.
 The minimization of CVaR in most situations also provides a minimum VaR
 because CVaR is always greater than VaR.
 Only in situations of extreme skewness does the minimum VaR differ greatly
 from the minimum CVaR.
 Rockafellar and Uryasev demonstrate the theoretical and mathematical possibilit
y of optimizing CVaR for portfolio asset allocation.

Sheikh and Qiao (2009) provide a real world application and verification
 of the use of fat tail distributions and CVaR as a risk measure in an asset
 allocation framework.
 They
\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 demonstrate that a fat tail distribution better describes the real world
 market environment than a normal distribution by showing that the Student’s
 t-copula more closely fits the historical data, especially the extreme
 events, than does the normal copula.
 .
 The paper also briefly touches on CVaR as a risk measure that better accounts
 for downside risk than variance.
 The paper then briefly looks at asset allocation using CVaR as a risk measure.
 It shows that the use of a Student’s t-copula assumption provides a lower
 downside risk (through lower CVaR) than does the use of a normal copula.
 Our research will focus on the verification and continuation of this asset
 allocation model with rebalancing.
 We will also look at the historical accuracy and advantage of using our
 asset allocation model in comparison to the traditional mean-variance asset
 allocation framework.

Portfolio Optimization Considerations Beyond Single Period Buy and Hold
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
So far, we have discussed methods for single period buy and hold portfolio
 optimization using CVaR as a risk measure and t-Copula as a joint probability
 distribution.
 Realistically, as certain assets outperform others, the asset allocation
 changes as well.
 Recent research considers expanding the optimization to incorporate multiple
 period rebalancing using the mean-variance framework as well as the mean-CVaR
 framework.

Rebalancing 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Master (2003) offers a simple rebalancing strategy, which involves setting
 a target allocation.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 The investor only rebalances when the allocation deviates beyond a set
 of trigger points.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 For instance, if the trigger point is 3% for all asset classes, then an
 investor only rebalances when the weight for any asset class deviates more
 than 3% from the target weight.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 This is also known as a tolerance band rebalancing strategy.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 According to Master, any rebalancing strategy should incorporate some basic
 assumptions.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 The benefit of rebalancing is inversely proportional to an investor's risk
 preference: if an investor is risk tolerant, meaning he is willing to endure
 higher risk for higher potential returns, then his tolerance band will
 be wider, meaning he will rebalance less often.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 It should also be noted that the benefit of rebalancing rises geometrically.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 For example, rebalancing at deviation of 6% from the target allocation
 provides up to four times as much benefit as rebalancing at deviation of
 3% of target allocation.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 The key benefit of rebalancing is to reduce this tracking error.
 Mathematically this can be represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Rebalancing Benefit }=\frac{{\text{Tracking Error}^{2}\cdot\delta^{2}}}{2\cdot\text{Risk Tolerance}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the deviation from the target allocation and Tracking Error represents
 how closely a portfolio follows the target allocation to which it is benchmarke
d.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
  
\change_unchanged
 The process of rebalancing involves the movement of capital across asset
 classes and
\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 incurs costs.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 While the benefit of rebalancing rises geometrically, transaction costs
 of rebalancing are linear: selling twice as much of an asset would cost
 twice as much.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 The net benefit of rebalancing is the difference between the benefit of
 rebalancing and the cost of rebalancing.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Sun (2006) extends the idea of Master’s paper to incorporate dynamic programming
 to minimize the cost of rebalancing.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 Sun applies the idea to CAPM models, which assume that asset returns are
 stationary, and that mean and variance are the primary portfolio statistics
 of interest.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 The optimal strategy is to rebalance only when the expected cost of trading
 is less than the expected cost of doing nothing.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 His conclusion is that periodic or tolerance band rebalancing provides
 suboptimal rebalanced portfolios.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 However, by treating the rebalancing problem as an optimization problem
 and solving it using dynamic programming, Sun was able to reduce overall
 costs of portfolio rebalancing.

Guastaroba (2009) applies rebalancing strategies to a portfolio optimization
 model that uses Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as the risk measure.
 The model incorporates rebalancing as a set of linear programming constraints.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 He introduces a decision variable to determine whether to rebalance based
 on
\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 how much the portfolio allocation deviates from a predetermined quantile.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 Fixed and variable transaction costs are both incorporated in the rebalancing
 decision.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 During every rebalancing period, an investor rebalances if net portfolio
 return, taking into account fixed and proportional transaction costs, is
 at least the predetermined required return.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 The paper then uses four in-and-out-of-sample windows to test the model
 for different levels of minimum required returns (0, 5%, and 10%) and different
 quantile measures (1%, 5%, 10% and 25%).

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 Based on the back-testing results, he concludes that for a very risk-averse
 investor the best choice is to rebalance two or three times in six months.

\change_deleted 0 1270508470
 
\change_unchanged
 On the other hand, a less risk-averse investor should rebalance one time
 or not rebalance at all.

Arithmetic and Compounding Returns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
We use two methods for calculating returns for a given time period.
 In the arithmetic approach, returns from a period are added to returns
 in the next period.
 In the compounding approach, returns from a period are compounded with
 the returns in the next period.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 be the return during period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{t}$
\end_inset

 be the portfolio value at the end of period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, we can express the two approaches as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\text{Compounding: }V_{t+1}=V_{t}\cdot(1+r_{t+1})\end{equation}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\text{Arithmetic: }V_{t+1}=V_{t}+r_{r+1}.\end{equation}

The use of arithmetic returns is mathematically and computationally convenient.
 Our initial analyses utilize arithmetic returns before extending the mean-CVaR
 framework to consider compounding and rebalancing.

 data of each individual asset class are first fit to independent, marginal
 Generalized Pareto Distribution; this GPD fit is piecewise so that a different
 function is fit to the lower tail and upper tail to account for marginal
 distribution fat tails.
 Next, independent marginal CDFs are transformed into their inverses, creating
 a uniform distribution over [0, 1].
 The historical returns are then applied to their respective inverse CDF's
 to determine a marginal probability of 
\change_deleted 0 1270508795
occurrence
\change_inserted 0 1270508808
 each return given the PDF
\change_unchanged
.
 Using Maximum Likelihood, a multivariate t-distribution fit is then constructed
 over these inverse CDF historical probabilities to construct a t-copula
 that is identified by a new correlation matrix and a single degree of freedom.

In order to simulate a certain number of months into the future, we generate

 A single month's return is simulated for all asset classes by generating

 following formula:

Analytical Mean-Variance Optimization

Markowitz (1952) pioneered the use of the normal mean-variance optimization
 framework for maximizing portfolio returns and minimizing portfolio risk
 (standard deviation).
 This framework analytically calculates the optimal set of portfolio returns
 and variances using the historical average return and historical standard
 deviation of each asset class along with the historical covariance between
 each pair of asset classes.

\begin_layout Standard

Our objective function is to find the weights that will minimize CVaR.
 CVaR is calculated analytically by trying out a set of asset weights for
 all 5000 simulations.
 Each simulation gives a final portfolio value, from which we can derive
 the monthly return rate by the formula: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
r=\frac{{V_{f}^{1/p}-1}}{b}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is the monthly return rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{f}$
\end_inset

 is the final portfolio value, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the number of periods we simulate into the future, and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is number of months in between which we rebalance.
 A periond is the interval in which we rebalance once; it is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 months.
 For instance, suppose we start with a $1 billion endowment and the final
 portfolio value is $24.62 billion.
 Suppose 
\change_inserted 0 1270509447
further that 
\change_unchanged
we simulate 36 months into the future, rebalancing every 12 months.
 Then our monthly return rate is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{24.62^{1/3}-1}{12}=0.16$
\end_inset

 monthly return rate by the formula.
 For each set of weights, we carry out 5000 simulations, giving us 5000
 monthly return rates.
 We take the average of the lowest 5%, or 250 final returns, to give us
 one CVaR.
 Our objective is to find the minimum CVaR.
 We will keep trying weights in an analytical fashion until we find the
 minimum CVaR.

The degrees of freedom signifies the degree of the fat tails.
 A degree of freedom of infinite is essentially a normal distribution; previous
 literature have found t-copulas with a degree of freedom of 32 to be a
 very close approximation of a normal copula.

Analytical Mean-Variance

We created analytical mean-variance efficient frontiers using the average
 returns and observed variances of the historical data, the unsmoothed historica
l data, and the simulation data.
 The similarity of the three efficient frontiers is a result of the similarity
 of the mean and variance statistics.

We first used the resulting weights of the analytical, normal mean-variance
 efficient frontiers to find their corresponding portfolio CVaR's given
 the simulation data.
 We used this as a comparison to the actual 'optimal' set of portfolios
 in a mean-CVaR framework.
 The efficient frontiers are as follows:

The results indicate that there exists a set of portfolios that has a lower
 CVaR (or higher return) than any of the analytical mean-variance portfolios.
 
\change_inserted 0 1270511700
This is intuitively captured by the fact that mean-CVaR line lies to the
 Northwest.
 
\change_unchanged
The portfolios that had maximized return and minimized variance in the previous
 optimization had a greater CVaR than portfolios that had minimized CVaR.
 This suggests the mean-variance optimization does not protect against situation
s of extreme losses and should not be the only consideration in asset allocation
 especially of preventing extreme downside risk is a concern.

Future research into the tradeoff between CVaR and variance may prove rewarding
 since both risk measures could prove relevant in different contexts.
 Also, a three dimensional optimization that maximizes return while minimizing
 variance and minimizing CVaR will produce an efficient frontier that is
 a plane.
 This would be an interesting framework for understanding the tradeoffs
 between return, variance, and downside risk and merits future investigation.

The mean-variance efficient frontier weights are not the most optimal allocation
s in both the rebalancing mean-CVaR framework and the compounding mean-CVaR
 framework.
 Significant improvement in return or in lower CVaR can be obtained in the
 compounding and rebalancing framework with different allocations than the
 normal mean-variance framework suggests.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
The achievement of higher returns and lower CVaR for the compounding portfolios
 in comparison to the rebalancing portfolios, especially at higher risk
 and return levels, must be considered in light of the use of a t-copula.
 The compounding and rebalancing portfolios at lower risk and lower CVaR
 are very similar but quickly diverge as the risk and CVaR increases.
 We believe this is because the t-copula is symmetric, so there exists a
 fat upper tail as well as a fat lower tail.
 In this case, compounding may outperform rebalancing by becoming overweight
 in high risk-high return assets.

\begin_layout Standard

The use of a t-copula to generate simulations appears to play a significant
 role in comparing the efficient frontiers of compounding and rebalancing
 in a mean-CVaR framekwork.

Although the standard t-copula to fit to the historical data did account
 for greater extreme events through a fat tail, the two tails were symmetric.
 Future research may consider asymmetric copulas such as the Gumbel or Clayton
 copulas.
