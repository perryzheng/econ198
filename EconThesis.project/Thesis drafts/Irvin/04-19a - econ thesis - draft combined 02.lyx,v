\begin_layout Abstract
\paragraph_spacing double
Traditional asset allocation methods for modeling the tradeoff between risk
 and return do not fully reflect empirical distributions.
 Thus recent research has moved away from assumptions of normality to account
 for risk by looking at 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fat tails
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and asymmetric distributions.
 Other studies have also considered multiple period frameworks to include
 asset rebalancing.
 We investigate the use of rebalancing with fat tail distributions, and
 optimizing with downside risk as a consideration.
 Our results verify the underperformance of traditional methods in the single
 period framework and also demonstrate the underperformance of traditional
 methods in a multiple period rebalancing framework.

Introduction and Literature Review

\paragraph_spacing double
The tradeoff between risk and return is the fundamental principle of the
 investment process.
 Although choosing individual investment opportunities is important, the
 top-down analysis of the entire investment portfolio is crucial for maintaining
 and updating investment goals.
 The decision of how to allocate capital across asset classes is a critical
 investment decision that serves as the foundation for building an investment
 strategy.
 Traditional mean-variance asset allocation frameworks use a normal distribution
 to model returns and variance as its risk measure.
 While these traditional methods for understanding risk and return have
 come under fire in the recent financial turmoil, research in alternative
 models is a growing and promising field.
 Recent research focuses on other risk measures for capturing downside risk
 and different probability distributions to account for extreme events

 We are interested in building upon the recent research in asset allocation

 by investigating how portfolio rebalancing can be included.

Markowitz (1952) pioneered the use of mean-variance optimization to understand
 the tradeoff between risk and return for a portfolio of risky assets.
 Markowitz assumed asset returns are normally distributed, providing a tractable
 model for the minimization of variance and the maximization of expected
 returns.
 The
\change_deleted 0 1271632926
 
\change_unchanged
 analytical solution of this optimization problem is a set of portfolios
 along the efficient frontier that represents the best possible returns
 for each level of variance.
 Markowitz set the foundation for asset allocation research and understanding
 the tradeoff between risk and return in a portfolio of risky assets.

In traditional mean-variance portfolio optimization frameworks,

it is assumed that returns are normally distributed and joint probabilities
 are properly capture by the historical, linear correlation matrix.
 The shortfall of this method is the thinness of the normal probability
 distribution's tail, implying a very low likelihood for situations where
 all asset classes are falling significantly in market crash scenarios.
 Recent research has proposed fitting a copula that can accommodate empirically
 higher probabilities of joint events (crashes or bubbles).
 A copula combines marginal cumulative distribution functions (CDF) and
 historical data of each asset class to create a best fit joint multivariate
 distribution.
 A Gaussian copula assumes a multivariate normal distribution whereas a
 t-copula utilizes a multivariate Student’s t-distribution, allowing for
 fatter tails.
 The t-copula provides a more accurate representation of real world financial
 markets and the probability of extreme events (Demarta and McNeil, 2004).

Sheikh and Qiao (2009) provide a real world application and verification
 of the use of fat tail distributions and CVaR as a risk measure in an asset
 allocation framework.
 It is demonstrated that a fat tail distribution better describes the real
 world market environment than a normal distribution;
\change_deleted 0 1271632926
 
\change_unchanged
 Student’s t-copula more closely fits the historical data, especially the
 extreme events, than does the normal copula.
 Furthermore, simulations generated from a t-copula more accurately reflects
 historical data than simulations generated from a normal copula.
 The presence of a fat tail in the t-copula allows for a more accurate represent
ation of extreme events for investigating downside risk.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Variance provides a mathematically simple measure of risk for asset allocation,
 but it is insufficient as a measure of downside risk.
 Variance symmetrically

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 accounts for both upside risk and downside risk since it is simply a measure
 of the sample’s average squared deviation from the arithmetic mean.
 When investment managers assess risk, they are typically more concerned
 with downside risk or losses and view upside risk (which may be referred
 to as “excess return”) favorably.
 Value-at-risk (VaR) has been incorporated as another risk measure that
 aims to better account for downside risk than variance.
 VaR is the minimum expected loss at a certain confidence level (typically
 5%) and can be calculatedfrom a probability density function (PDF) of return
 data (either historical or simulated).
 However, VaR
\change_deleted 0 1271632926
 
\change_unchanged
 fails to capture the extent of the possible losses beyond the specified
 (5%) cutoff.
 It is possible to have two PDF’s with the same VaR (loss associated with
 the cutoff of 5%) but one with a fatter tail and greater losses to the
 left of the specified (5%) cutoff.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) attempts to rectify this problem: CVaR
 is the expected loss given a negative outcome that is greater than the
 VaR level, and it can be calculated as a weighted

 average of the worst case losses (Agrawal, 2008).

\change_deleted 0 1271632926
 
\change_unchanged
 CVaR is a more reliable risk measure than VaR under non-normal and non-continuo
us probability distributions because it is a “coherent risk measure” and
 is “sub-additive and convex” (Krohmal, Palmquist, and Uryasev, 2002).
 This means that the CVaR of a portfolio is always less than or equal to
 the sum of the CVaR of the weighted individual asset classes; furthermore,
 it can be extended from continuous probability distributions to discrete
 scenarios, allowing for optimization using simulations or discrete distribution
s and eliminating anomalous results such as multiple local minima.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Rockafellar and Uryasev (1999) demonstrate the use of CVaR in an asset allocatio
n framework and the ability to optimize CVaR using linear programming methods.
 The ability to use linear programming stems from the way CVaR is calculated.
 Theoretically, CVaR is simply the average value beyond the specified cutoff
 (5%) calculated using the calculus of integrals.
 Rockafellar and Uryasev (1999) demonstrate that the use of simulations
 and a summation to estimate the theoretical CVaR can be exploited to find
 the minimum CVaR.
 The minimization of CVaR in most situations also provides a minimum VaR
 because CVaR is always greater than VaR.
 Only in cases of extreme skewness does the minimum VaR differ greatly from
 the minimum CVaR.
 Rockafellar and Uryasev demonstrate the theoretical and mathematical possibilit
y of optimizing CVaR for portfolio asset allocation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Sheikh and Qiao (2009) show how the CVaR framework is a useful way to compare
 normal distributions and fat-tail distributions.
 The optimal mean-CVaR efficient frontier calculated using simulations generated
 from a normal copula underestimates the downside risk in comparison to
 the optimal efficient frontier calculated using simulations generated from
 a t-copula.
 Also, the mean-variance optimization had higher downside risk and a more
 concentrated asset allocation in comparison the the mean-CVaR efficient
 frontier.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
So far, we have discussed methods for single period buy and hold portfolio
 optimization using CVaR as a risk measure and a t-copula as a joint probability
 distribution.
 Realistically, as certain assets outperform others, the asset allocation
 changes endogenously as well.
 Recent research considers expanding the optimization to incorporate multiple
 period rebalancing using the mean-variance framework as well as the mean-CVaR
 framework.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Master (2003) offers a simple rebalancing strategy in the normal mean-variance
 framework, which involves setting a target allocation.
 The investor only rebalances when the allocation deviates beyond a set
 of trigger points.
 For instance, if the trigger point is 3% for all asset classes, then an
 investor only rebalances when the weight for any asset class deviates more
 than 3% from the target weight.
 This is also known as a tolerance band rebalancing strategy.
 According to Master, any rebalancing strategy should incorporate some basic
 assumptions.
 The benefit of rebalancing is inversely proportional to an investor's risk
 preference: if an investor is risk tolerant, meaning he is willing to endure
 higher risk for higher potential returns, then his tolerance band will
 be wider, meaning he will rebalance less often.
 The key benefit of rebalancing is to reduce the tracking error, which is
 how closely a portfolio follows its target allocation benchmark.
 
\backslash
 The process of rebalancing involves the movement of capital across asset
 classes and incurs costs.

\change_deleted 0 1271632926
 
\change_unchanged
 The net benefit of rebalancing is the difference between the benefit of
 rebalancing and the cost of rebalancing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Sun (2006) extends the concepts of Master’s research to incorporate dynamic
 programming to minimize the cost of rebalancing.
 Sun applies the idea to CAPM models, which use mean and variance as the
 primary portfolio statistics of interest.
 The optimal strategy is to rebalance only when the expected cost of trading
 is less than the expected cost of doing nothing.
 His conclusion is that periodic or tolerance band rebalancing provides
 suboptimal rebalanced portfolios.
 However, by treating the rebalancing problem as an optimization problem
 and solving it using dynamic programming, Sun was able to reduce overall
 costs of portfolio rebalancing and maximize returns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Guastaroba (2009) applies rebalancing strategies to a portfolio optimization
 model that uses Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as the risk measure.
 The model incorporates rebalancing as a set of linear programming constraints.
 He introduces a decision variable to determine whether to rebalance based
 on how much the portfolio allocation deviates from a predetermined quantile.
 Fixed and variable transaction costs are both incorporated in the rebalancing
 decision.
 During every rebalancing period, an investor rebalances if net portfolio
 return, taking into account fixed and proportional transaction costs, is
 at least the predetermined required return.
 The paper then uses four in-and-out-of-sample windows to test the model
 for different levels of minimum required returns (0, 5%, and 10%) and different
 quantile measures (1%, 5%, 10% and 25%).
 Based on the back-testing results, he concludes that for a very risk-averse
 investor the best choice is to rebalance two or three times in six months.
 On the other hand, a less risk-averse investor should rebalance once or
 not at all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Our research goal is to build off of the recent advances in asset allocation
 research by extending rebalancing to the mean-CVaR framework using a t-copula.
 We have reproduced the previous single period mean-CVaR model with a t-copula
 and have shown that the normal mean variance framework underpeforms in
 both the single period and rebalancing models.
 Furthermore, we investigated the tradeoff between CVaR and variance and
 have found a small increase in variance in the optimal mean-CVaR portfolios
 while obtaining a larger decrease in the downside risk (CVaR) in comparison
 to the optimal mean-variance portfolios.

The three highest returning asset classes are equities, commodities, and

 Commodities has the highest variance followed by real estate and equities.
 Equities and real estate have a particularly high inflation while commodities
 has a low, positive correlation to those two asset classes.
 The lowest returning asset class with the lowest variance is cash, while
 credit, interest rates, and inflation have intermediate returns and variances.
 Credit has a particularly high historical correlation with interest rates,
 inflation, and real estate; also, interest rates and inflation are highly
 correlated.
 These return and correlation characteristics will be evident in the simulations
 and impact the efficient frontier optimizations.

t-Copula Fitting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
The historical return data of each individual asset class are first fit
 to independent, marginal Generalized Pareto Distribution; this GPD fit
 is piecewise so that a different function is fit to the lower tail and
 upper tail to account for marginal distribution fat tails.
 Next, independent marginal CDFs are transformed into their inverses, creating
 a uniform distribution over [0, 1].
 The historical returns are then applied to their respective inverse CDF's
 to determine a marginal probability of each return given the PDF.
 Using Maximum Likelihood, a multivariate t-distribution fit is then constructed
 over these inverse CDF historical probabilities to construct a t-copula
 that is identified by a new correlation matrix and a single degree of freedom.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The resulting t-Copula fit is centered at zero with characteristic fat tails,
 similar to a standard normal distribution, and is used for generating simulatio

 multiple single month returns for all asset classes.
 A single month's return is simulated for all asset classes by generating
 multivariate random numbers from the t-Copula fit and applying it to the
 following formula:

 is a vector of the generated multivariate t random numbers.
 We use the average historical, empirical monthly returns and historical,
 empirical standard deviations of each asset class in our research for consisten
cy and objectiveness.
 When simulations are drawn out of a t-copula, the likelihood of a market
 crash scenario is an order of magnitude higher than that of a Gaussian
 copula.

We simulated monthly returns of the seven asset classes for three years
 into the future using the t-copula fitted to the unsmoothed monthly return
 data.
 We ran one thousand

 As can be observed in Tables

\end_inset

 & 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, the summary statistics of the t-copula simulations in comparison to the
 historical data show that the simulations have average returns close to
 the unsmoothed historical averages but have a wider range of returns exhibited
 in the higher standard deviations.

The degrees of freedom signifies the extent of the fat tails.
 A degree of freedom of infinite is essentially a normal distribution; previous

 Returns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
We use two methods for calculating returns for a given time period.
 In the arithmetic approach, returns from a period are added to returns
 in the next period.
 In the 
\change_deleted 0 1271605940
compounding
\change_inserted 0 1271605941
geometric returns
\change_unchanged
 approach, returns from a period are multiplied to the returns in the next
 period.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 be the return during period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{t}$
\end_inset

 be the portfolio value at the end of period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, we can express the two approaches as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\text{Geometric: }V_{t+1}=V_{t}\cdot(1+r_{t+1})\end{equation}

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

\end_inset

The use of arithmetic returns is mathematically and computationally convenient.
 Our initial analyses utilize arithmetic returns before extending the mean-CVaR
 framework to consider 
\change_deleted 0 1271605930

 between the lowest and highest single asset class return (where the portfolio
 is 100% weighted in that single asset class) to determine the set of portfolios

\end_inset

 is the number of periods we simulate into the future, and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is number of months in between which we rebalance.
 A period is the interval in which we rebalance once; it is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 months.
 For instance, suppose we start with a $1 billion endowment and the final
 portfolio value is $24.62 billion.
 Suppose further that we simulate 36 months into the future, rebalancing
 every 12 months.
 Then our monthly return rate is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{24.62^{1/3}-1}{12}=0.16$

 monthly return rate by the formula.
 For each set of weights, we carry out 5000 simulations, giving us 5000

Single Period (buy and hold) Mean-CVaR 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
We first used the resulting weights of the analytical, normal mean-variance
 efficient frontiers to find their corresponding portfolio CVaR's given
 the simulation data.
 We used this as a comparison to the actual 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

optimal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 set of portfolios in a mean-CVaR framework.
 The resulting efficient frontiers are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:meancvar_Single-Per-Arith"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
The results indicate that there exists a set of portfolios that has a lower
 CVaR (or higher return) than any of the analytical mean-variance portfolios.
 This is intuitively captured by the fact that optimal mean-CVaR frontier
 lies to the upper left.
 The portfolios that had maximized return and minimized variance in the
 previous optimization had a greater CVaR than portfolios that had minimized
 CVaR.
 This suggests the mean-variance optimization does not protect against situation
s of extreme losses and should not be the only consideration in asset allocation
 especially if preventing extreme downside risk is a central concern.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
The convergence of the efficient frontiers at the end points is due to the
 fact that only a portfolio that is 100% weighted in a single asset class
 can achieve the lowest possible return and the highest possible return.
 The outperformance of the optimal mean-CVaR efficient frontier in comparison
 to the mean-variance efficient frontier can be seen in the portfolios between
 the two endpoints.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Unlike the analytical mean-variance framework, the mean-CVaR framework allows
 for the risk value to be negative.
 A CVaR less than zero means that the worst 5% performance is a negative
 loss or a small gain.
 It is difficult to use an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

information ratio
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sharpe ratio
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 since the intersection of the efficient frontier and the y-axis leads to
 arbitrarily large ratios.
 It is interesting to note that for an expected loss of 0%, the optimal
 mean-CVaR portfolio will return almost 35 basis points more than the mean-varia
nce portfolio.

The mean-variance efficient frontier weights are not the most optimal allocation
s in both the rebalancing mean-CVaR framework and the geometric mean-CVaR
 framework.
 The results indicate that an optimal mean-CVaR portfolio exists in both
 the geometric and the rebalancing frameworks that significantly outperforms
 the mean-variance portfolios in the respective frameworks.
 Significant improvement in higher returns or in lower CVaRs can be obtained
 over the normal mean-variance efficient frontiers.

 but quickly diverge as the risk and CVaR increase
\change_deleted 0 1271606885

.
 We believe this is because the t-copula is symmetric, so there exists a

geometric

 have slightly higher variances than the optimal mean-variance efficient
 frontier (< 0.3%).
 Although there is a slightly higher variance in the optimal mean-CVaR portfolio
s in comparison to the optimal mean-variance portfolios, the optimal mean-CVaR
 portfolios have much less downside risk as CVaR (0.3 - 1.0%).

This suggests that the cost of protecting against downside risk is only
 slightly higher variance in the portfolio's returns.
 This supports our hypothesis that the mean-CVaR framework, both for single
 period and rebalancing, outperforms the mean-variance portfolio and can
 be a powerful tool

The differences in the efficient frontier performance in terms of returns
 and CVaR stems from the different asset allocations for each portfolio.
 In order to visualize the differences in the allocation of capital amongst
 the seven asset classes, we used a 3D-ribbon graph for each of the optimal
 efficient frontiers (mean-variance and mean-CVaR)

We have 
\change_deleted 0 1271607154
developed
\change_inserted 0 1271607155
implemented
\change_unchanged
 a set of asset allocation models that utilize a non-normal joint probability
 distribution, minimize CVaR as the risk measure, and account for portfolio
 rebalancing.
 Our results support the previous literature that a mean-variance framework
 underestimates downside risk.
 We have shown that variance minimization does not lead to the minimization
 of downside risk and underperforms the optimal minimum CVaR efficient frontier;
 however, the optimal minimum CVaR efficient frontier has slightly higher
 variances than the optimal minimum variances efficient frontier.
 Our results suggest that CVaR is a viable and important risk measure for
 investors to consider alongside variance since it better accounts for downside
 risk.
 However, in the pursuit of outperformance, investors should carefully consider
 the tradeoff between higher returns and both risk factors, variance and
 CVaR.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
We have demonstrated that the optimal set of mean-variance portfolios perform
 poorly when looking at downside risk using CVaR in both a single period
 and in multiple-period rebalancing.
 In the single period mean-CVaR framework for both arithmetic and 
\change_inserted 0 1271606747
geometric
\change_deleted 0 1271606747
compounding
\change_unchanged
 returns, the mean-variance portfolios are suboptimal, since a different
 set of portfolio weights has a higher return and/or a lower CVaR.
 Mean-variance especially underperforms in the cases of intermediate returns
 and medium levels of risk, suggesting that portfolios with low risk/returns
 and high risk/returns share similar CVaR and variance levels.
 This may be because the low risk-return and the high risk-return portfolios
 tend to be more heavily concentrated in one asset class.
 In the multiple period rebalancing mean-CVaR framework, the mean-variance
 portfolios again underperform in comparison to the optimal mean-CVaR portfolios.
 This underperformance is also most pronounced in the medium risk-return
 region.

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Since mean-variance inherently utilizes a normal distribution, the optimal
 mean-variance efficient frontiers do not account for scenarios of extreme
 joint losses.
 Our use of a t-copula allowed us to properly simulate scenarios with a
 frequency of extreme losses similar to that observed in the historical
 data.
 The outperformance of the optimal mean-CVaR efficient frontier in comparison
 to the mean-variance efficient frontier is evidence that the mean-variance
 optimization does not account for the extreme losses.
 Furthermore, the variance of the optimal mean-CVaR portfolios in each of
 our analyses is marginally higher (< 0.3 %) than the variance of the correspondi
ng optimal mean-variance portfolio.
 This is smaller than the comparable gain in lower downside risk or CVaR
 (0.3 - 1.0 %) of the optimal mean-CVaR efficient frontier in comparison to
 the optimal mean-variance efficient frontier.
 This is further evidence that the optimal mean-CVaR analyses for both single
 period and rebalancing offer pertinent insight into the risk of extreme
 losses in comparison to the traditional mean-variance framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
We have produced promising results for understanding rebalancing in the
 mean-CVaR framework with non-normal joint distributions.
 Our rebalancing framework assumed no transaction costs and enforced a mandatory
 annual redistribution of capital to the original weights.
 It was surprising for us to find that the mean-CVaR single period 
\change_inserted 0 1271606747
geometric
\change_deleted 0 1271606747
compounding
\change_unchanged
 efficient frontier outperforms the corresponding rebalancing efficient
 frontier.
 This suggests that the endogenous process of a high risk, high return asset
 class becoming overweight in a single period portfolio contributes significantl
y.
 It may be interesting to investigate a dynamic optimization technique that
 includes a decision variable whether to rebalance; however, we suspect
 that the difficulty in predicting future random returns may hinder the
 value of this process.
 The real benefit in a dynamic optimization process would be to bring our
 current rebalancing model a step closer to real world situations with transacti
on costs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Future research into the tradeoff between CVaR and variance may prove rewarding
 since both risk measures could prove relevant in different contexts.
 A three dimensional optimization that maximizes return while minimizing
 variance and minimizing CVaR will produce an efficient frontier that is
 a plane.
 This would be an interesting framework for understanding the tradeoffs
 between return, variance, and downside risk and merits future investigation.
 Also, future research implementing transaction costs and a decision variable
 to determine when to rebalance may prove valuable as a continuation of
 the multiple period rebalancing mean-CVaR framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
The process of asset allocation is critical for understanding the overall
 behavior of a portfolio of risky assets.
 Our research has built off of the recent developments in applying fat-tail
 distributions, downside risk measures, and rebalancing.
 We have developed a simple rebalancing model that incorporates a fat-tail
 joint distribution in a mean-CVaR framework and have demonstrated the underperf
ormance of the traditional mean-variance framework.
