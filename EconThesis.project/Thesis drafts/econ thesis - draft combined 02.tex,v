\section{Introduction}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
The tradeoff between risk and return is the fundamental principle
of the investment process. Although choosing individual investment
opportunities is important, the top-down analysis of the entire investment
portfolio is crucial for maintaining and updating investment goals.
The decision of how to allocate capital to a few select asset classes
is a very important investment decision; the asset allocation has
been shown to influence almost 80\% of  portfolio returns. 

Traditional mean-variance asset allocation frameworks use a normal
distribution to model returns and variance as a risk measure. While
these traditional methods for understanding risk and return have come
under fire in the recent financial turmoil, research in alternative
models is a growing and promising field. Recent research focuses on
other risk measures for capturing downside risk and different probability
distributions to account for extreme events. We are interested in
building upon the recent research in asset allocation models by investigating
how portfolio rebalancing can be included. 

The central assumption to asset allocation research and implementation
is that investors can reasonably model future market behavior using
historical data and past events. The historical return data are fit
to probability distributions and correlations are used to understand
how asset classes behave together. The normal distribution has been
popular because of the simplicity of obtaining an analytical solution
to the variance minimization and mean return maximization problems.
The assumption that future returns will follow the same distribution
as historical data allows the simulation of future returns. Our research
aims to utilize other distributions and joint distributions that better
account for extreme events in novel asset allocation frameworks. 

The minimization of risk is required in the asset allocation process.
Variance may not be the best risk measure to account for downside
risk since it is a measure of upside and downside volatility. Recent
research has utilized other risk measures instead of variance to better
account for downside risk. The minimization of these new risk measures
has been proven theoretically and demonstrated using simulations. 

Our research goal is to build off of the recent advances in asset
allocation research by developing a rebalancing framework. We will
investigate how using non-normal probability distributions along with
downside risk measures perform in a rebalancing asset allocation optimization
problem.

In this paper, we will first present the previous literature and the
theoretical framework for each concept used in current asset allocation
research. Next, we will describe our methods and implementation of
the different parts of the asset allocation models. We will then end
with our results and discussion.

\section{Theoretical Framework and Literature Review}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
Markowitz (1952) pioneered the use of mean-variance optimization to
understand the tradeoff between risk and return for a portfolio of
risky assets. Markowitz assumed asset returns are normally distributed,
allowing for an analytical solution to the minimization of variance
and the maximization of expected return. The elegant analytical solution
of this optimization problem is a set of portfolios along the efficient
frontier that represents the best possible returns for each level
of variance. Markowitz set the foundation for asset allocation research
and understanding the tradeoff between risk and return in a portfolio
of risky assets.

The assumptions of normality and variance as a risk measure in asset
allocation have come under pressure since the groundbreaking work
of Markowitz's portfolio theory in light of the market crises in the
past two decades. Research in the past decade has focused on accommodating
the occurrence of extreme events and more relevant measures of risk
besides variance. The application of this research utilizes simulation
data to understand the tradeoff between risk and return with computer
optimization techniques. Our research aims to further develop the
mean-CVaR framework along with the t-Copula probability distribution
to incorporate portfolio rebalancing and to compare these strategies
against traditional mean-variance frameworks. 

In traditional mean-variance portfolio optimization frameworks, Monte
Carlo simulations are run from a Gaussian (normal) joint distribution
for a basket of asset classes. The shortfall of this method is the
thinness of the tail, implying a very low likelihood for situations
where all asset classes are falling significantly in market crash
scenarios. The advantage of using a t-copula is that it can accommodate
higher probabilities of joint events (crashes or bubbles). A copula
combines marginal cumulative distribution functions (CDF) and historical
data of each asset class to create a best fit joint multivariate distribution.
A Gaussian copula assumes a multivariate normal distribution whereas
a t-copula utilizes a multivariate Student\textquoteright{}s t-distribution,
allowing for fatter tails. The t-copula provides a more accurate representation
of real world financial markets and the probability of extreme events
(Demarta and McNeil, 2004). 

Another problem with the mean-variance optimization framework is that
it assumes underlying returns are uncorrelated across time (Fisher,
1994). This is clearly not the case, as higher returns in one period
may lead to equally higher returns the next period because of high
expectations of market trends. To correct for this auto-correlation
between period-to-period returns and to establish the independence
of single-period returns, we used the well-known Fisher-Geltner-Webb's
{}``unsmoothing'' methodology. 

Variance provides a mathematically simple measure of risk for asset
allocation, but it is insufficient as a measure of downside risk.
Variance symmetrically accounts for both upside risk and downside
risk since it is simply a measure of the sample\textquoteright{}s
average squared deviation from the arithmetic mean. When investment
managers assess risk, they are typically more concerned with downside
risk or losses and view upside risk (which may be referred to as \textquotedblleft{}excess
return\textquotedblright{}) favorably. Value-at-risk (VaR) has been
incorporated as another risk measure that aims to better account for
downside risk than variance. VaR is the minimum expected loss at a
certain confidence level (typically 5\%) and can be calculated by
taking the value of the return at the specified (5\%) boundary of
a probability density function (PDF) of return data (either historical
or simulated). Although VaR better accounts for downside risk than
variance does, it fails to capture the extent of the possible losses
beyond the specified (5\%) cutoff. It is possible to have two PDF\textquoteright{}s
with the same VaR (loss associated with the cutoff of 5\%) but one
with a fatter tail and greater losses to the left of the specified
(5\%) cutoff. 

Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) attempts to rectify this problem:
it is the expected loss given a negative outcome that is greater than
the VaR level, and it can be calculated as a weighted average of the
worst case losses (Agrawal, 2008). Formally, let X be a random variable
denoting a portfolio's loss and $VaR_{\alpha}(X)$ be the VaR at the
$100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence level. Then $CVaR_{a}(X)$ is defined
as:

\[
CVaR_{\alpha}(X)=E[X|X\text{\ensuremath{\ge}}Var_{\alpha}(X)]\]


Furthermore, CVaR is a more reliable risk measure than VaR under non-normal
and non-continuous probability distributions because it is a \textquotedblleft{}coherent
risk measure\textquotedblright{} and is \textquotedblleft{}sub-additive
and convex\textquotedblright{} (p. 3, Krohmal, Palmquist, and Uryasev,
2002). This means that the CVaR of a portfolio is always less than
or equal to the sum of the CVaR of the weights of the individual asset
classes; furthermore, it can be extended from continuous probability
distributions to discrete scenarios, allowing for optimization using
simulations or discrete distributions and eliminating anomalous results
such as multiple local minima. 

Rockafellar and Uryasev (1999) demonstrate the use of CVaR in an asset
allocation framework and the ability to optimize CVaR using linear
programming methods. The ability to use linear programming stems from
the way CVaR is calculated. Theoretically, CVaR is simply the average
value beyond the specified cutoff (5\%) calculated using the calculus
of integrals. Rockafellar and Uryasev demonstrate that the use of
simulations and a summation to estimate the theoretical CVaR can be
exploited to find the minimum CVaR. The minimization of CVaR in most
situations also provides a minimum VaR because CVaR is always greater
than VaR. Only in situations of extreme skewness does the minimum
VaR differ greatly from the minimum CVaR. Rockafellar and Uryasev
demonstrate the theoretical and mathematical possibility of optimizing
CVaR for portfolio asset allocation. 

Sheikh and Qiao (2009) provide a real world application and verification
of the use of fat tail distributions and CVaR as a risk measure in
an asset allocation framework. They demonstrate that a fat tail distribution
better describes the real world market environment than a normal distribution
by showing that the Student\textquoteright{}s t-copula more closely
fits the historical data, especially the extreme events, than does
the normal copula. The paper also briefly touches on CVaR as a risk
measure that better accounts for downside risk than variance. The
paper then looks at asset allocation using CVaR as a risk measure.
It shows that the use of a Student\textquoteright{}s t-copula assumption
provides a lower downside risk (through lower CVaR) than does the
use of a normal copula. Our research will focus on  a continuation
of this asset allocation model with rebalancing. We will also look
at the historical accuracy and advantage of using our asset allocation
model in comparison to the traditional mean-variance asset allocation
framework. 

So far, we have discussed methods for single period buy and hold portfolio
optimization using CVaR as a risk measure and t-Copula as a joint
probability distribution. Realistically, as certain assets outperform
others, the asset allocation changes endogenously as well. Recent
research considers expanding the optimization to incorporate multiple
period rebalancing using the mean-variance framework as well as the
mean-CVaR framework. 

Master (2003) offers a simple rebalancing strategy, which involves
setting a target allocation. The investor only rebalances when the
allocation deviates beyond a set of trigger points. For instance,
if the trigger point is 3\% for all asset classes, then an investor
only rebalances when the weight for any asset class deviates more
than 3\% from the target weight. This is also known as a tolerance
band rebalancing strategy. According to Master, any rebalancing strategy
should incorporate some basic assumptions. The benefit of rebalancing
is inversely proportional to an investor's risk preference: if an
investor is risk tolerant, meaning he is willing to endure higher
risk for higher potential returns, then his tolerance band will be
wider, meaning he will rebalance less often. It should also be noted
that the benefit of rebalancing rises geometrically. For example,
rebalancing at a deviation of 6\% from the target allocation provides
up to four times as much benefit as rebalancing at deviation of 3\%
of target allocation. The key benefit of rebalancing is to reduce
the tracking error. Mathematically this can be represented as $\text{Rebalancing Benefit }=\frac{{\text{Tracking Error}^{2}\cdot\delta^{2}}}{2\cdot\text{Risk Tolerance}}$
where $\delta$ is the deviation from the target allocation and Tracking
Error represents how closely a portfolio follows the target allocation
to which it is benchmarked. The process of rebalancing involves the
movement of capital across asset classes and incurs costs. While the
benefit of rebalancing rises geometrically, the transaction costs
of rebalancing are linear: selling twice as much of an asset would
cost twice as much. The net benefit of rebalancing is the difference
between the benefit of rebalancing and the cost of rebalancing. 

Sun (2006) extends the concepts of Master\textquoteright{}s research
to incorporate dynamic programming to minimize the cost of rebalancing.
Sun applies the idea to CAPM models, which use mean and variance as
the primary portfolio statistics of interest. The optimal strategy
is to rebalance only when the expected cost of trading is less than
the expected cost of doing nothing. His conclusion is that periodic
or tolerance band rebalancing provides suboptimal rebalanced portfolios.
However, by treating the rebalancing problem as an optimization problem
and solving it using dynamic programming, Sun was able to reduce overall
costs of portfolio rebalancing. 

Guastaroba (2009) applies rebalancing strategies to a portfolio optimization
model that uses Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as the risk measure.
The model incorporates rebalancing as a set of linear programming
constraints. He introduces a decision variable to determine whether
to rebalance based on how much the portfolio allocation deviates from
a predetermined quantile. Fixed and variable transaction costs are
both incorporated in the rebalancing decision. During every rebalancing
period, an investor rebalances if net portfolio return, taking into
account fixed and proportional transaction costs, is at least the
predetermined required return. The paper then uses four in-and-out-of-sample
windows to test the model for different levels of minimum required
returns (0, 5\%, and 10\%) and different quantile measures (1\%, 5\%,
10\% and 25\%). Based on the back-testing results, he concludes that
for a very risk-averse investor the best choice is to rebalance two
or three times in six months. On the other hand, a less risk-averse
investor should rebalance one time or not rebalance at all. 

These papers give us a starting point for incorporating rebalancing
into our model. We also incorporated t-copula joint distributions
and CVaR as a risk measure when rebalancing.

\section{Data}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
We used benchmark data obtained from the Duke University Management
Company (DUMAC). The data consisted of historical monthly returns
for the benchmarks representing seven asset classes: Morgan Stanley
Capital International (MSCI) All World (\$) for equity, Goldman Sachs
Commodity index (GSCI) for commodities, a blend of benchmarks  for
credit%
\footnote{1973-1984 Investment Grade Index, %
}, Barclays Capital U.S. Treasury Intermediate for interest rate, a
blend of benchmarks  for inflation sensitive%
\footnote{inflation blend%
}, National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NaREIT) for
real estate, and Citi 3-month T-bills for cash. The benchmark return
data ranged from 1973 to 2009 and are all publicly available. We also
used the historical asset allocations of DUMAC as a reference.

\section{Methodology}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}

\subsection{Arithmetic and Compounding Returns}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
We use two methods for calculating returns for a given time period.
In the arithmetic approach, returns from a period are added to returns
in the next period. In the compounding approach, returns from a period
are multiplied to the returns in the next period. Let $r_{t}$ be
the return during period $t$ and $V_{t}$ be the portfolio value
at the end of period $t$, we can express the two approaches as:

\begin{equation}
\text{Compounding: }V_{t+1}=V_{t}\cdot(1+r_{t+1})\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\text{Arithmetic: }V_{t+1}=V_{t}+r_{r+1}.\end{equation}
The use of arithmetic returns is mathematically and computationally
convenient. Our initial analyses utilize arithmetic returns before
extending the mean-CVaR framework to consider compounding and rebalancing.
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}

\subsection{t-Copula}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
The historical return data of each individual asset class are first
fit to independent, marginal Generalized Pareto Distribution; this
GPD fit is piecewise so that a different function is fit to the lower
tail and upper tail to account for marginal distribution fat tails.
Next, independent marginal CDFs are transformed into their inverses,
creating a uniform distribution over {[}0, 1{]}. The historical returns
are then applied to their respective inverse CDF's to determine a
marginal probability of each return given the PDF. Using Maximum Likelihood,
a multivariate t-distribution fit is then constructed over these inverse
CDF historical probabilities to construct a t-copula that is identified
by a new correlation matrix and a single degree of freedom. 

The resulting t-Copula fit is centered at zero with characteristic
fat tails, similar to a standard normal distribution, and is used
for generating simulations. The multivariate t probability density
function is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
f(x)=\frac{\Gamma(\frac{v+d}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{v}{2})\sqrt{(\pi v)^{d}|\Sigma|}}(1+\frac{(x+\mu)'\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu)}{v})^{-\frac{v+d}{2}}\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\Gamma(x)=\int_{0}^{\inf}t^{x-1}e^{-t}dt\label{eq:Gamma function}\end{equation}
 where $d$ is the number of dimensions, $v$ is the degrees of freedom,
$\mu$ is the mean (zero, in this case), $\Sigma$ is the correlation
matrix, and $\Gamma$ is the gamma function as defined in Equation
\ref{eq:Gamma function}.
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}

\subsubsection{Generate Simulations}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
In order to simulate a certain number of months into the future, we
generate multiple single month returns for all asset classes. A single
month's return is simulated for all asset classes by generating multivariate
random numbers from the t-Copula fit and applying it to the following
formula:

\begin{equation}
\text{Simulated One Month Return}=\mu+\sigma\cdot\vec{x}\end{equation}


where $\mu$ is a vector of the historical monthly returns for each
asset class, $\sigma$ is a vector of the historical standard deviations
for each asset class, and $\vec{x}$ is a vector of the generated
multivariate t random numbers. We use the average historical, empirical
monthly returns and historical, empirical standard deviations of each
asset class in our research for consistency and objectiveness. When
simulations are drawn out of a t-copula, the likelihood of a market
crash scenario is an order of magnitude higher than that of a Gaussian
copula. 
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}

\subsection{Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) }
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
In order to calculate the CVaR of a certain portfolio over a set of
simulations, we sort the average returns of all the simulations from
lowest to highest and take the average of the lowest $\beta * Number of Simulation$
values.

\begin{equation}
\beta\text{-CVaR}=\frac{{1}}{(\beta\cdot n)}\sum_{i=1}^{\beta\cdot n}r_{i}\label{eq:CVaR calculation}\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number of simulations, $r_{i}$ is the i-th lowest
simulated return of an asset class, and $\beta$ is the desired CVaR
level (expressed as a percentage, e.g. 5\%). 
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}

\subsection{Analytical Mean-Variance Optimization}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
Markowitz (1952) pioneered the use of the normal mean-variance optimization
framework for maximizing portfolio returns and minimizing portfolio
risk (standard deviation). This framework analytically calculates
the optimal set of portfolio returns and variances using the historical
average return and historical standard deviation of each asset class
along with the historical covariance between each pair of asset classes.
Let $R$ be the fixed portfolio monthly return rate and $r_i$ the
average historical monthly return of each asset class. The optimization
problem can be expressed as follows:\begin{equation}
\min_{w_{1},w_{2},...w_{n}}\text{{\ensuremath{\sigma^{2}}}}(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\sigma^{2}(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}^{2}\cdot\sigma_{i}^{2}+2\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j>i}^{n}w_{i}\cdot w_{j}\cdot\text{Cov(}i,j\text{) }\end{equation}

\end{doublespace}

\begin{equation}
\text{Cov(}i,j\text{)}=\sigma_{i}\cdot\sigma_{j}\cdot\rho_{ij}\end{equation}


\begin{doublespace}
\begin{equation}
w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n}>0\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
w_{1}+w_{2}+...+w_{n}=1\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}\cdot r_{i}=R\end{equation}
The optimization uses multiple levels of $R$ between the lowest and
highest single asset class return (where the portfolio is 100\% weighted
in that single asset class) to determine the set of portfolios along
the efficient frontier. 
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}

\subsection{Single Period Simulated Mean-CVaR Optimization }
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
The single period optimization of mean-CVaR minimizes CVaR at each
given level of return. The optimization calculates the CVaR as described
in Equation \ref{eq:CVaR calculation} while satisfying the condition
that the average return across all simulations is equal to the given
level of return we are optimizing on. Since this is a single period
optimization, arithmetic returns are used. 

Let $w_{i}$ denote the weight for asset class $i$, $R$ be the fixed
portfolio monthly return rate as defined before and $\tilde{R}$ be
the calculated portfolio monthly return rate at each run of the simulation.
We have the following optimization problem: 

\begin{equation}
\min_{w_{1},w_{2},...w_{n}}\text{{CVaR}}(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n}>0\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
w_{1}+w_{2}+...+w_{n}=1\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\tilde{R}(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})=R(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
V_{t}=V_{t}+\sum_{i=1}^{t}r_{i}\end{equation}


Our two linear constraints indicate that the weights must sum to one
and be nonnegative (since no borrowing is allowed). Since we want
to optimize on a fixed return, our nonlinear constraint is that our
average final portfolio return $\tilde{R}$ across all simulations
must be equivalent to the given fixed portfolio return $R$. 
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}

\subsection{Simulated Mean-CVaR Optimization with Compounding \label{sub:Simulated-Mean-CVaR-Optimization}}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
We adopt the compounding approach in this optimization. 

\begin{equation}
\min_{w_{1},w_{2},...w_{n}}\text{{CVaR}}(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n}>0\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
w_{1}+w_{2}+...+w_{n}=1\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\tilde{R}(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})=R(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
V_{t+1}=V_{t}\cdot(1+r_{t+1})\end{equation}


Our two linear constraints indicate that the weights must sum to one
and be nonnegative (since no borrowing is allowed). Since we want
to fix return, our nonlinear constraint is that our final portfolio
return $\tilde{R}$ must be the same as the given fixed portfolio
return $R$. 
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}

\subsection{Simulated Mean-CVaR Optimization with Rebalancing and Compounding}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
The implementation is the same as in Section \ref{sub:Simulated-Mean-CVaR-Optimization}
with one additional feature: every 12 months, we rebalance the portfolio
to the predetermined weights. We sum up the returns in that year and
we distribute the portfolio value according to a predetermined set
of weights and then compound it with future returns. Keeping all the
variables the same, and let $\vec{{V}_{t}^{'}}$ be the portfolio
vector after rebalancing. $\vec{{V}_{t}^{'}}$ contains the value
of each asset class at the end of time $t$. We have the following
nonlinear programming optimization problem:

\begin{equation}
\min_{w_{1},w_{2},...w_{n}}\text{{CVaR}}(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n}>0\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
w_{1}+w_{2}+...+w_{n}=1\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\tilde{R}(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})=R(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
V_{t+1}=V_{t}\cdot(1+r_{t+1})\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\vec{{V}_{t}^{'}}=V_{t}\cdot(w_{1},w_{2},..,w_{n})\label{eq:constraint}\end{equation}


where the only addition is equation \ref{eq:constraint}. It specifies
that at each time period $t$, we redistribute the value of the portfolio
according to a predetermined vector of weights to obtain a portfolio
vector containing the values of each asset class.

Our objective function is to find the weights that will minimize CVaR.
CVaR is calculated analytically by trying out a set of asset weights
for all 5000 simulations. Each simulation gives a final portfolio
value, from which we can derive the monthly return rate by the formula: 

\begin{equation}
r=\frac{{V_{f}^{1/p}-1}}{b}\end{equation}
where $r$ is the monthly return rate, $V_{f}$ is the final portfolio
value, $p$ is the number of periods we simulate into the future,
and $b$ is number of months in between which we rebalance. A period
is the interval in which we rebalance once; it is equal to $b$ months.
For instance, suppose we start with a \$1 billion endowment and the
final portfolio value is \$24.62 billion. Suppose further that we
simulate 36 months into the future, rebalancing every 12 months. Then
our monthly return rate is $\frac{24.62^{1/3}-1}{12}=0.16$ monthly
return rate by the formula. For each set of weights, we carry out
5000 simulations, giving us 5000 monthly return rates. We take the
average of the lowest 5\%, or 250 final returns, to give us one CVaR.
Our objective is to find the minimum CVaR. We will keep trying weights
in an analytical fashion until we find the minimum CVaR.

t-Copula degrees of freedom: 25.25

The degrees of freedom signifies the extent of the fat tails. A degree
of freedom of infinite is essentially a normal distribution; previous
literature have found t-copulas with a degree of freedom of 32 to
be a very close approximation of a normal copula.

\subsection{Efficient Frontiers}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}

\subsubsection{Analytical Mean-Variance}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
We created analytical mean-variance efficient frontiers using the
average returns and observed variances of the historical data, the
unsmoothed historical data, and the simulation data. The similarity
of the three efficient frontiers is a result of the similarity of
the mean and variance statistics. 
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}

\subsubsection{Single Period (buy and hold) Mean-CVaR }
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
We first used the resulting weights of the analytical, normal mean-variance
efficient frontiers to find their corresponding portfolio CVaR's given
the simulation data. We used this as a comparison to the actual {}``optimal''
set of portfolios in a mean-CVaR framework. The efficient frontiers
are as follows: 

The results indicate that there exists a set of portfolios that has
a lower CVaR (or higher return) than any of the analytical mean-variance
portfolios. This is intuitively captured by the fact that optimal
mean-CVaR frontier lies to the Northwest. The portfolios that had
maximized return and minimized variance in the previous optimization
had a greater CVaR than portfolios that had minimized CVaR. This suggests
the mean-variance optimization does not protect against situations
of extreme losses and should not be the only consideration in asset
allocation especially if preventing extreme downside risk is a central
concern. 
\end{doublespace}

The convergence of the efficient frontiers at the end points is due
to the fact that only a portfolio that is 100\% weighted in a single
asset class can achieve the lowest possible return and the highest
possible return. The outperformance of the optimal mean-CVaR efficient
frontier in comparison to the mean-variance efficent frontier can
be seen in the portfolios between the two endpoints. 

Unlike the analytical mean-variance framework, the mean-CVaR framework
allows for the risk value to be negative. A CVaR less than zero means
that the worst 5\% performance is a negative loss or a small gain.
It is difficult to use an {}``information ratio'' or a {}``Sharpe
ratio'' since the intersection of the efficient frontier and the
y-axis leads to arbitrarily large ratios. It is interesting to note
that for an expected loss of 0\%, the optimal mean-CVaR portfolio
will return almost 35 basis points more than the mean-variance portfolio. 

\begin{doublespace}

\subsubsection{Rebalancing and Compounding Mean-CVaR}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
In the following efficient frontier, we demonstrate the optimal tradeoff
between CVaR and return when comparing annual compounding and annual
rebalancing for a 10 year simulation period:

The mean-variance efficient frontier weights are not the most optimal
allocations in both the rebalancing mean-CVaR framework and the compounding
mean-CVaR framework. The results indicate that an optimal mean-CVaR
portfolio exists in both the compounding and the rebalancing frameworks
that significantly outperforms the mean-variance portfolios in the
respective frameworks. Significant improvement in higher returns or
in lower CVaRs can be obtained over the normal mean-variance efficient
frontiers. 

The achievement of higher returns and lower CVaR for the compounding
portfolios in comparison to the rebalancing portfolios, especially
at higher risk and return levels, must be considered in light of the
use of a t-copula. The compounding and rebalancing portfolios at lower
risk and lower CVaR are very similar but quickly diverge as the risk
and CVaR increases. We believe this is because the t-copula is symmetric,
so there exists a fat upper tail as well as a fat lower tail. In this
case, compounding may outperform rebalancing by allowing the portfolio
to become overweight in high risk-high return assets. 

The use of a t-copula to generate simulations appears to play a significant
role in comparing the efficient frontiers of compounding and rebalancing
in a mean-CVaR framework. 

Future research implementing transaction costs and a decision variable
to determine when to rebalance may prove valuable in this mean-CVaR
framework.

\subsection{Other Copulas and Joint Distributions}

\begin{doublespace}
Although the standard t-copula to fit to the historical data did account
for greater extreme events through a fat tail, the two tails were
symmetric. Future research may consider asymmetric copulas such as
the Gumbel or Clayton copulas.

\section{Conclusion}
\end{doublespace}

We have developed a set of asset allocation models that utilize a
non-normal joint probability distribution, minimize CVaR as the risk
measure, and account for portfolio rebalancing. Our results support
the previous literature that a mean-variance framework under estimates
downside risk. We have shown that variance minimization does not lead
to the minimization of downside risk and underperforms the optimal
minimum CVaR efficient frontier. Our results suggest that CVaR is
a viable and important risk measure for investors to continue alongside
variance since it better accounts for downside risk. However, in the
pursuit of outperformance, investors should carefully consider the
tradeoff between higher returns and both risk factors, variance and
CVaR. 

We have demonstrated that the optimal set of mean-variance portfolios
perform poorly when looking at downside risk using CVaR in a single
period buy-and-hold strategy. The mean-variance portfolios are suboptimal
in the single period mean-CVaR framework, where a different set of
portfolio weights has a higher return and/or a lower CVaR. Mean-variance
especially underperforms in the cases of intermediate returns and
medium levels of risk, suggesting that portfolios with low risk/returns
and high risk/returns share similar CVaR and variance levels. 

Since mean-variance inherently utilizes a normal distribution, the
optimal mean-variance efficient frontiers do not account for scenarios
of extreme joint losses. Our use of a t-copula allowed us to properly
simulate scenarios with a frequency of extreme losses similar to that
observed in the historical data. The outperformance of the optimal
mean-CVaR efficient frontier in comparison to the mean-variance efficient
frontier is evidence that the mean-variance optimization does not
account for the extreme losses. 

We have produced promising results for understanding rebalancing in
the mean-CVaR framework with non-normal joint distributions. Our rebalancing
framework assumed no transaction costs and enforced a mandatory annual
redistribution of capital to the original weights. It was surprising
for us to find that the mean-CVaR single period compounding efficient
frontier outperforms the corresponding rebalancing efficient frontier.
This suggests that the endogenous process of a high risk, high return
asset class becoming overweight in a single period portfolio contributes
significantly. It may be interesting to investigate a dynamic optimization
technique that includes a decision variable whether to rebalance;
however, we suspect that the difficulty in predicting future random
returns may hinder the value of this process. The real value in a
dynamic optimization process would be to bring our current rebalancing
model a step closer to real world situations with transaction costs. 

\begin{doublespace}
Future research into the tradeoff between CVaR and variance may prove
rewarding since both risk measures could prove relevant in different
contexts. A three dimensional optimization that maximizes return while
minimizing variance and minimizing CVaR will produce an efficient
frontier that is a plane. This would be an interesting framework for
understanding the tradeoffs between return, variance, and downside
risk and merits future investigation. 
\end{doublespace}

The process of asset allocation is critical for understanding the
overall behavior of a portfolio of risky assets. Our research has
built off of the recent developments in applying fat-tail distributions,
downside risk measures, and rebalancing. We have developed a simple
rebalancing model that incorporates a fat-tail joint distribution
in a mean-CVaR freamwork and have demonstrated the underperformance
of the traditional mean-variance framework. Our results have posed
several new and interesting questions for future research in asset
allocation with rebalancing.
