Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tradeoff between risk and return is the fundamental principle of the
 investment process.
 Although choosing individual investment opportunities is important, the
 top-down analysis of the entire investment portfolio is crucial for maintaining
 and updating investment goals.
 The decision of how to allocate capital to a few select asset classes is
 a very important investment decision; the asset allocation has been shown
 to influence almost 80% of the portfolio returns

\begin_layout Standard
Traditional mean-variance asset allocation frameworks use a normal distribution
 to model returns and variance as a risk measure.
 While these traditional methods for understanding risk and return have
 come under fire in the recent financial turmoil, research in alternative
 models is a growing and promising field.
 Recent research focuses on other risk measures for capturing downside risk
 and different probability distributions to account for extreme events.
 We are interested in building upon the recent asset allocation models by
 investigating how portfolio rebalancing can be included.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The central assumption to asset allocation research and implementation is
 that investors can reasonably model future market behavior using historical
 data and past events.
 The historical return data are fit to probability distributions and correlation
s are used to understand how asset classes behave together.
 The normal distribution has been popular because of the simplicity of obtaining
 an analytical solution to the variance minimization and mean return maximizatio
n problem.
 The assumption that future returns will follow the same distribution as
 historical data allows the simulation of future returns.
 Our research aims to utilize other distributions and joint distributions
 that better account for extreme events in novel asset allocation frameworks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The minimization of risk is required in the asset allocation process.
 Variance may not be the best risk measure to account for downside risk,
 since it is a measure of upside and downside volatility.
 Recent research has utilized other risk measures instead of variance to
 better account for downside risk.
 The minimization of these new risk measures has been shown theoretically
 and demonstrated using simulations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our research goal is to build off of the recent advances in asset allocation
 research by developing a rebalancing framework.
 We will investigate how using non-normal probability distributions along
 with downside risk measures perform in a rebalancing asset allocation optimizat
ion problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we will first present the previous literature and the theoretical
 framework for each concept used in current asset allocation research.
 Next, we will describe our methods and implementation of the different
 parts of the asset allocation models.
 We will then end with our results and discussion.

The assumption that returns are distributed normally is especially inadequate
 for modeling market behavior since it cannot properly account for market
 crashes.

\begin_layout Standard
The tradeoff between risk and return is the fundamental theme for understanding
 a portfolio of investments in risky assets, and investments are usually
 grouped by their asset classes in order to understand the aggregate behavior
 of the asset classes and the portfolio as a whole.
 The asset allocation policy is the single most important high level decision
 that dictates the behavior and exposure of the entire portfolio.

\begin_layout Standard
We investigate recent advancements in asset allocation through the use of
 a new risk measure, non-normality in the probability distributions, and
 rebalancing.

The risk management of large instutitional investment portfolios requires

 process, a thorough understanding of the entire portfolio of investments
 is critical for risk management and high level investment strategy.

When performing high level portfolio analyses, investors typically look
 at large classes of possible investment vehicles or asset classes.
 The asset allocation decision sets the tone of the entire investment portfolio
 through differing levels of exposure to risks and return opportunities.
