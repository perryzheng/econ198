\begin_layout Standard
We have reproduced and implemented the concepts of the JPMorgan paper as
 a starting point for our investigation of the value of rebalancing as a
 consideration for allocating assets in the mean-CVaR framework.
 The historical return data of our asset classes benchmarks are first tested
 for first order monthly autocorrelation and then 'unsmoothed' to remove
 autocorrelation.
 Next, the historical return data are individually fit to marginal Generalized
 Pareto Distributions before combining the historical correlation matrix
 and fit to a joint t-Copula distribution.
 We then run simulations for monthly returns for 3 years by drawing out
 of the joint t-Copula distribution.
 We optimize our efficient frontier for return and CVaR based on this simulation
 dataset only.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin the one-period (buy and hold) CVaR analysis by establishing a baseline
 for comparison.
 The weights of the mean-variance efficient frontiers for historical arithmetic
 averages and unsmoothed historical arithmetic averages are applied to our
 simulation data to determine the CVaR and return of each weight.
 The pseudo-mean-CVaR efficient frontier derived from these mean-variance
 weights are used as the starting weights for finding the optimal portfolio,
 assuming there is another weight that can provide a lower CVaR and/or a
 higher return.
 We use MATLAB's built-in optimization function 'fmincon' for finding an
 optimal efficient frontier.
 The objective function to be minimized is the CVaR while the non-linear
 constraint to be satisfied is a set return, the average return of the portfolio
 across the simulations must be approximately equal to the constraint.
 We generate an efficient frontier by using each of the historical mean-variance
 portfolio returns as our non-linear constraints for finding the minimum
 CVaR.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we investigate the ability for multi-period optimization and account
 for rebalancing in constructing the efficient frontier.
 We first implement a simple model that rebalances back to the target weight
 every 12 months and incurs no transaction costs.
 We integrate the rebalancing function to our objective function in calculating
 portfolio CVaRs and into our non-linear constraint for calculating average
 portfolio returns across all simulations for our 'fmincon' optimization.
 We are currently investigating the use of a decision function for determining
 whether to rebalance at each specified time period based on transaction
 cost, deviation from the target weights, change in portfolio variance,
 or change in portfolio CVaR.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will compare our CVaR based efficient frontiers to their respective mean-vari
ance counterparts to determine the strengths and weaknesses of both methods.
 We will use historical data as well as newly generated simulation data
 for testing hypotheses.
 We may also investigate the use of investor expectation in generating the
 simulation returns by using the expected mean and expected standard deviation
 of each asset class.
