Beyond Normal and Variance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Investment strategy has evolved since the groundbreaking work of Markowitz
 (1952).
 The assumptions of normality and variance as a risk measure, although mathemati
cally simple and elegant to work with, have come under challenge during
 the recent financial turmoil.
 Research in the past decade have focused on accommodating the occurrence
 of fat-tail or extreme events and more relevant measures of risk besides
 variance.
 The application of this research utilizes simulations to understand the
 tradeoff between risk and return with computer optimization techniques.
 Our research aims to further develop the mean-CVaR framework along with
 the t-Copula probability distribution to incorporate portfolio rebalancing
 and to compare these strategies against traditional mean-variance frameworks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

t-Copula
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
In traditional mean-variance portfolio optimization frameworks, Monte Carlo
 simulations are run from a Gaussian (normal) joint distribution for the
 basket of asset classes.
 The shortfall of this method is the thinness of the tail, implying a very
 low likelihood for situations where all asset classes are falling significantly
 in market crash scenarios.
 The advantage of using a t-copula is it can accommodate higher probabilities
 of joint events (crashes or bubbles).
 A copula combines marginal cumulative distribution functions (CDF) and
 historical data of each asset class to create a best fit multivariate joint
 distribution.
 A Gaussian copula assumes a multivariate normal distribution whereas a
 t-copula utilizes a multivariate Student’s t-distribution, allowing for
 fatter tails.
 The t-copula provides a more accurate representation of real world financial
 markets and the probability of extreme events (Demarta and McNeil, 2004).

Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as Risk Measure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Variance provides a mathematically simple measure of risk for asset allocation,
 but it adds little value as a  measure of downside risk.
 Variance symmetrically accounts for both upside risk and downside risk
 since it is simply a measure of the sample’s average squared deviation
 from the arithmetic mean.
 When investment managers look at risk, they are typically concerned with
 downside risk or losses and view upside risk (which may be referred to
 as “excess return”) as a result of skill, expertise, good fortune, and
 value added.
 Value-at-risk (VaR) has been incorporated as another risk measure that
 aims to better account for downside risk than variance.
 VaR is the minimum loss expected at a certain confidence level (typically
 5%) and can be calculated by taking the value of the return at the specified
 (5%) boundary of a probability density function (PDF) of return data (either
 historical or simulated).
 Although VaR does a better job of accounting for downside risk than variance,
 it does not capture the extent of the possible losses beyond the specified
 (5%) cutoff.
 It is possible to have two PDF’s with the same VaR (loss associated with
 the cutoff of 5%) but one with a fatter tail and greater losses to the
 left of the specified (5%) cutoff.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) attempts to rectify this problem: it is
 the expected loss given a loss beyond the value-at-risk and can be calculated
 as a weighted average of the worst case losses.
 Furthermore, CVaR is a more reliable risk measure than VaR under non-normal
 and non-continuous probability distributions because it is a “coherent
 risk measure” and is “sub-additive and convex” (p.
 3, Krohmal, Palmquist, and Uryasev, 2002).
 In other words, the CVaR of a portfolio is always less than or equal to
 the sum of the CVaR of the weights of the individual asset classes and
 can be extended from continuous probability distributions to discrete scenarios
 such as in simulations, allowing for  optimization using simulations or
 discrete distributions and eliminating anomalous results such as multiple
 local minima.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Rockafellar and Uryasev (1999) demonstrate the use of CVaR in an asset allocatio
n framework and the ability to optimize CVaR using linear programming methods.
 The ability to use linear programming stems from the way CVaR is calculated.
 Theoretically, CVaR is simply the average value beyond the specified cutoff
 (5%) calculated using the calculus of integrals.
 Rockafellar and Uryasev demonstrated that the use of simulations and a
 summation to estimate the theoretical CVaR can be exploited to find the
 minimum CVaR.
 The minimization of CVaR in most situations also provides a minimum VaR
 because CVaR is always greater than VaR.
 Only in situations of extreme skewness does the minimum VaR differ greatly
 from the minimum CVaR.
 Rockafellar and Uryasev demonstrate the theoretical and mathematical possibilit
y of optimizing CVaR for portfolio asset allocation.

JPMorgan's paper
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
JPMorgan’s (2009) “Non-Normality of Market Returns” paper provides a real
 world application and verification of the use of fat tail distributions
 and CVaR as a risk measure in an asset allocation framework.
  They conclude that a fat tail distribution better describes the real world
 market environment than a normal distribution.
  The paper also briefly touches on CVaR as a risk measure that better accounts
 for downside risk than variance.
 It shows that the Student’s t-copula more closely fits the historical data,
 especially the extreme events, than does the normal copula.
 The paper then briefly looks at asset allocation using CVaR as a risk measure.
  It shows that the use of a Student’s t-copula assumption provides a lower
 downside risk (through lower CVaR) than does the use of a normal copula.
 JPMorgan’s paper demonstrates an implementation of the t-copula and CVaR
 in an asset allocation framework fits historical data better than does
 the traditional mean-variance framework.
 Our research will focus on the implementation and continuation of this
 asset allocation model with constraints, cash reserves, and rebalancing.
  We will also look at the historical accuracy and advantage of using our
 asset allocation model in comparison to the traditional mean-variance asset
 allocation framework.

Portfolio Optimization Considerations Beyond Single Period Buy and Hold
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
So far, we have discussed methods for single period buy and hold portfolio
 optimization using CVaR as a risk measure and t-Copula as a joint probability
 distribution.
 Recent research has also considered expanding the optimization to incorporate
 multiple period rebalancing using mean variance as well as mean-CVaR.

Rebalancing 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
The previous literature review considers a single time frame portfolio optimizat
ion, where an asset allocation is set at the beginning of the period and
 the portfolio is unchanged until the end of the investment period.
  Master (2003) offers a simple rebalancing strategy, which involves setting
 a target allocation.
  The investor only rebalances when the allocation deviates beyond a set
 of trigger points.
  For instance, if the trigger point is 3% for all asset classes, then an
 investor only rebalances when the weight for any asset class deviates more
 than 3% from the target weight.
  This is also known as a tolerance band rebalancing strategy.
  According to Master, any rebalancing strategy should incorporate some
 basic assumptions.
  The benefit of rebalancing is inversely proportional to an investor's
 risk preference: if an investor is risk tolerant, meaning he is willing
 to endure higher risk for higher potential returns, then his tolerance
 band will be wider, meaning he will rebalance less often.
  It is also worthwhile to note that the benefit of rebalancing rises geometrica
lly.
  For example, rebalancing at deviation of 6% of target allocation provides
 up to four times as much benefit as rebalancing at deviation of 3% of target
 allocation.
  Mathematically this can be represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Rebalancing Benefit }=\frac{{\text{Tracking Error}^{2}\cdot\delta^{2}}}{2\cdot\text{Risk Tolerance}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the deviation from the target allocation and Tracking Error represents
 how closely a portfolio follows the target allocation to which it is benchmarke
d.
  The key benefit of rebalancing is to reduce this tracking error.
 Rebalancing also involves transactions of asset classes, which incurs costs.
  While the benefit of rebalancing rises geometrically, transaction costs
 of rebalancing are linear: selling twice as much of an asset would cost
 twice as much.
  The net benefit of rebalancing is the difference between the benefit of
 rebalancing and the cost of rebalancing.
  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Sun (2006) extends the idea of Master’s paper to incorporate dynamic programming
 to minimize the cost of rebalancing.
  Sun applies the idea to CAPM models, which assume that asset returns are
 stationary, and that mean and variance are the primary portfolio statistics
 of interest.
  The optimal strategy is to rebalance only when the expected cost of trading
 is less than the expected cost of doing nothing.
  His conclusion is that periodic or tolerance band rebalancing provides
 suboptimal rebalanced portfolios.
  However, by treating the rebalancing problem as an optimization problem
 and solving it using dynamic programming, Sun was able to reduce overall
 costs of portfolio rebalancing.
  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Guastaroba (2009) applies rebalancing strategies to a portfolio optimization
 model that uses Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as the risk measure.
 The model incorporates rebalancing as a set of linear programming constraints.
  He introduces a decision variable to determine whether to rebalance based
 on whether the portfolio allocation deviated from a predetermined quantile.
  He also incorporates both fixed and variable transaction costs.
  During every rebalancing period, an investor rebalances if net portfolio
 return, taking into account fixed and proportional transaction costs, is
 at least the predetermined required return.
  The paper then uses four in-and-out-of-sample windows to test the model
 for different levels of minimum required returns (0, 5%, and 10%) and different
 quantile measures (1%, 5%, 10% and 25%).
  Based on the back-testing results, he concludes that for a very risk-averse
 investor the best choice is to rebalance two or three times in six months.
  On the other hand, a less risk-averse investor should rebalance one time
 or not rebalance at all.
  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
These papers give us a starting point for incorporating rebalancing into
 our model.
  Our goal is to analyze and compare the different rebalancing strategies:
 a simple periodic strategy that rebalances every few months, a tolerance-band
 strategy that rebalances when allocation deviates beyond a predetermined
 range, or a dynamic programming approach that actively calculates the expected
 cost of future transactions.
  We will then incorporate the use of t-copulas for fat tails, CVaR as a
 risk measure, and rebalancing as a portfolio strategy to produce a realistic
 asset allocation framework for a large institutional investor such as an
 endowment.

t-Copula
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
The historical data of each individual asset class are first fit to independent,
 marginal Generalized Pareto Distribution; this GPD fit is piecewise so
 that a different function is fit to the lower tail and upper tail to account
 for marginal distribution fat tails.
 Next, independent marginal CDFs are transformed into their inverses, creating
 a uniform distribution over [0, 1].
 The historical returns are then applied to their respective inverse CDF's
 to determine a marginal probability of occurrence.
 Using Maximum Likelihood, a multivariate t-distribution fit is then constructed
 over these inverse CDF historical probabilities to construct a t-copula
 that is identified by a new correlation matrix and a single degree of freedom.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
The resulting t-Copula fit is centered at zero with characteristic fat tails,
 similar to a standard normal distribution, and is used for generating simulatio
ns.
 The multivariate t probability density function from Demarta and McNeil
 (2002) is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
f(x)=\frac{\Gamma(\frac{v+d}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{v}{2})\sqrt{(\pi v)^{d}|\Sigma|}}(1+\frac{(x+\mu)'\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu)}{v})^{-\frac{v+d}{2}}\end{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
In order to simulate a certain number of months into the future, we generate
 multiple single month returns for all asset classes.
 A single month's return is simulated for all asset classes by generating
 multivariate random numbers from the t-Copula fit and applying it to the
 following formula:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\text{Simulated One Month Return}=\mu+\sigma\cdot\vec{x}\end{equation}

 We use the average historical, empirical monthly returns and historical,

 When simulations are drawn out of a t-copula, the likelihood of a market
 crash scenario is an order of magnitude higher than that of a Gaussian
 copula.

Analytical Mean-Variance Optimization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Markowitz (1952) pioneered the use of the normal mean-variance optimization
 framework for maximizing portfolio returns and minimizing portfolio risk
 (standard deviation).
 This framework analytically calculates the optimal set of portfolio returns
 and variances using the historical average return and historical standard
 deviation of each asset class along with the historical covariance between
 each pair of asset classes.
 The optimization problem can be expressed as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\min_{w_{1},w_{2},...w_{n}}\text{{\sigma^{2}}}(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})\end{equation}

 The optimization uses multiple levels of

 between the lowest and highest single asset class return (where the portfolio
 is 100% weighted in that single asset class) to determine the set of portfolios

Simulated Mean-CVaR Optimization 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
When designing our simulation we have two implementation choices as to how
 to calculate the returns.
 In the compounding approach, returns from a period are compounded with
 the returns in the next period.
 In the arithmetic approach, returns from a period are added to returns
 in the next period.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 be the return during period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{t}$
\end_inset

 be the portfolio value at the end of period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, we can express the two approaches as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\text{Compounding: }V_{t+1}=V_{t}\cdot(1+r_{t+1})\end{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\text{Arithmetic: }V_{t+1}=V_{t}+r_{r+1}.\end{equation}

\end_inset

Unless otherwise noted, we adopt the arithmetic approach.

Simulated Mean-CVaR Optimization with Compounding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
In our implementation, we have 5000 simulations of returns for seven asset
 classes, a set of starting weights and a set of fixed portfolio returns
 for which we derive from the Mean-Variance framework.
 Our goal is to find the set of weights that will minimize CVaR given a
 target level of return.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
We adopt the compounding approach in this section.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$
\end_inset

denote the weight for asset class 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 be the fixed portfolio monthly return rate and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{R}$
\end_inset

 be the calculated portfolio monthly return rate at each run of the simulation.
 We have the following optimization problem: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\min_{w_{1},w_{2},...w_{n}}\text{{CVaR}}(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})\end{equation}

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\tilde{R}(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})=R(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})\end{equation}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
Our two linear constraints indicate that the weights must sum to one and
 be nonnegative (since no borrowing is allowed).
 We also have a nonlinear constraint.
 Since we want to fix return, our nonlinear constraint is that our final
 portfolio return

 must be the same as the given fixed portfolio return

 according to a predetermined set of weights, and then compound it with
 future returns.
 Keeping all the variables the same, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{{V}_{t}^{'}}$
\end_inset

 be the portfolio vector after rebalancing.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{{V}_{t}^{'}}$
\end_inset

 contains the value of each asset class at the end of time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 We have the following nonlinear programming optimization problem:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\min_{w_{1},w_{2},...w_{n}}\text{{CVaR}}(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n}>0\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
w_{1}+w_{2}+...+w_{n}=1\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\tilde{R}(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})=R(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
V_{t+1}=V_{t}\cdot(1+r_{t+1})\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\vec{{V}_{t}^{'}}=V_{t}\cdot(w_{1},w_{2},..,w_{n})\label{eq:last_constraint}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
where the only addition is equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

.
 It specifies that at each time period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, we redistribute the value of the portfolio according to a predetermined
 vector of weights to obtain a portfolio vector containing the values of
 each asset class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Our objective function is to find the weights that will minimize CVaR.
 CVaR is calculated analytically by trying out a set of asset weights for
 all 5000 simulations.
 Each simulation gives a final portfolio value, from which we can derive
 the monthly return rate by the formula: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
r=\frac{{V_{f}^{1/p}-1}}{b}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is the monthly return rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{f}$
\end_inset

 is the final portfolio value, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the number of periods we simulate into the future, and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is number of months in between which we rebalance.
 A periond is the interval in which we rebalance once; it is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 months.
 For instance, suppose we start with 1 (billion) endowment and the final
 portfolio value is 24.62 (billion).
 Suppose we simulate 36 months into the future, rebalancing every 12 months.
 Then our monthly return rate is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{24.62^{1/3}-1}{12}=0.16$
\end_inset

 monthly return rate by the formula.
 For each set of weights, we carry out 5000 simulations, giving us 5000
 monthly return rates.
 We take the average of the lowest 5%, or 250 final returns, to give us
 one CVaR.
 Our objective is to find the minimum CVaR.
 We will keep trying weights in an analytical fashion until we find the
 minimum CVaR.

Single Period (buy and hold) Mean-CVaR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

We first used the resulting weights of the analytical, normal-mean variance
 efficient frontiers to find their corresponding portfolio CVaR's given
 the simulation data.
 We used this as a comparison to the actual 'optimal' set of portfolios
 in a mean-CVaR framework, which we find using MATLAB's 
\family sans
fmincon()
\family default
 function.
 The results indicate that there exists a set of portfolios that has a lower
 CVaR (or higher return) than any of the analytical mean variance portfolios.
